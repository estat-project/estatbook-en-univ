**Statistics**

The invention of letters has led human to record of an era which is now
called a history. Because of the history, we are able to know which
country appeared where, when, how large its territory is, how much
population and how many households they have. The land size of a
country, population, and the number of households are typical examples
of statistics for a country which have been used for more than thousands
of years until now. These statistics were essential for a ruler to
govern a country. The origin of the word "statistics" comes from the
word "state" which implies a tool for governing a country. In ancient
Egypt, Greece and Rome, data such as population and farmland area were
made and used for the management of their country.

In the 8th to 13th century, the concept of probability and inference was
introduced. Arab mathematicians Al-Khalil (717--786) wrote a book which
describes permutations and combinations, to list all possible Arabic
words with and without vowels. Al-Kindi (801--873) and later Arab
cryptographers developed the early statistical inference for decoding
encrypted messages. Ibn Adlan (1187--1268) later made an important
contribution, on the use of sample size in frequency analysis.

In the 17th to the early 19th century, the mathematical foundations of
modern statistics were laid with the development of the probability
theory by Gerolamo Cardano, Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat.
Mathematical probability theory arose from the study of games of chance,
although the concept of probability was already examined in medieval law
by philosophers such as Juan Caramuel. The method of least squares was
first described by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805.

In the late 19th century, Francis Galton and Karl Pearson transformed
statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis,
not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton
introduced the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression
analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the
variety of human characteristics such as height, weight, eyelash length
among others. Pearson developed the product-moment correlation
coefficient and the method of moments for the fitting of distributions
to samples.

In the early 20th century, Ronald Fisher wrote the textbooks that were
to define the academic discipline in universities around the world.
Fisher\'s most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper, "The
Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian
Inheritance" which was the first to use the statistical term, variance.
He contributed with his classic 1925 work "Statistical Methods for
Research Workers" and 1935 work "The Design of Experiments" which
developed rigorous design of experiment models. He originated the
concepts of sufficiency, ancillary statistics, Fisher\'s linear
discriminator and Fisher information. He applied statistics to various
biological concepts such as Fisher\'s principle. In the 1930s, Egon
Pearson and Jerzy Neyman introduced the concepts of \"Type II\" error,
power of a test and confidence intervals. Jerzy Neyman showed that
stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation
than quota sampling.

Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve
decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of
data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on
statistical methodology. The use of modern computers has expedited
large-scale statistical computations and has also made possible new
methods that are impractical to perform manually. Modern statistics is
the discipline that efficiently collects data, summarizes data and
analyzes it to make scientific decisions using various probabilistic
models for decision making in uncertain situations.

**Data Science**

Modern digital computers, first developed in 1946 by John Eckert and
John Mockley of the University of Pennsylvania, began to be applied to
reality in the 1960s and have made tremendous progress in the past half
century and brought many changes in our society. In the 1980s, with the
development of personal computer (PC) and communication technology, main
frame computers started to connect each other and then PCs were
connected to the main frame computers using internet. In the 2000s, a
mobile phone called a 'smartphone', which is combination of computer and
traditional telephone was created and it was connected to computers via
wired and wireless network technologies. Nowadays, almost all kinds of
computers and mobile phones around the world have been connected with
high speed internet that brings radical changes to our society.

The development of computer and communication technologies has been
intensified recently, creating the artificial intelligence (AI) that
surpasses human intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) in which
all electronic devices are connected to computers via the Internet. A
society which utilizes the AI and the IoT will be radically different
from the present, such as an automatic car, a robot doctor and a robot
teacher, and it is called the fourth industrial revolution society.

The development of these technologies has created massive data, simply
called 'Big Data', that were unimaginable in the past. Typical examples
of the big data include data from Google\'s search records, social media
messages by mobile phones, web logs by internet connections, and
telephone records of global telecom companies. The big data are expected
to grow and increase exponentially in the future and the
hyper-forecasting is also expected to be possible. The success or
failure of each individual, group, company and even country would depend
on how to utilize the big data efficiently.

The analysis of the big data that emerged this century is so enormous
and diverse in the amount of data that can not be fully utilized just by
traditional statistical approaches. For the analysis and utilization of
the big data, theories of statistics, computer science, mathematics,
management or related disciplines must also be applied simultaneously.
Data Science is a new area of study in which statistics, mathematics,
computer science and other disciplines are fused to analyze and utilize
the big data that emerged this century.

rate has improved a lot.
:::

Methodologies that are used in the analysis of big data include many
traditional statistical methods such as estimation, testing hypothesis,
multivariate statistical analysis and linear model. Recent theories in
mathematics such as neural network, supporting vector machines and
recent theories in computer science such as distributed computing,
machine learning, artificial intelligence are also used. Since the Data
Science is a fusion of studies, understanding of several disciplines is
not easy to study, but it would be feasible in general for those who
have talent on mathematics. For those who studied the Data Science could
be leaders of the fourth industrial revolution society.

This book introduces not only fundamental statistical theories for data
analysis, but also introduces a statistical software 『eStat』 to
analyze data which is essential in data science.

**Statistics**

This book is written for an introductory of Statistics and Data Science,
focused on visualization and summary of data and traditional statistical
methods by using a computer software 『eStat』.

All statistical methods are dealing with numbers or characters which is
called a set of data. This set of data can be a whole set of data we are
interested in or a part of data depending on a problem. If we make a
decision using the whole set of data which we are interested in, the set
of data is called a population. It is often very difficult or impossible
to obtain the whole set of data in the population. In order to study
characteristics of the population, if some number of data are extracted
from the population, it is called a sample.

**Population and Sample**

**Population** is a whole set of data which we are interested in.

**Sample** is some number of data extracted from the population.
:::

::: mainTable
There are two main fields where statistical methods are applied. The
first field is an example of analyzing the population of a country such
as gender, age, and occupation. In this case, we study how to
effectively visualize and summarize data in order to understand the
characteristics of the population better. These methods of visualizing
and summarizing data are called descriptive statistics. The second field
is how to infer characteristics of a population using a sample or how to
test hypothesis on the population characteristics using a sample. These
methods are called inferential statistics.
:::

::: mainTableYellow
**Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics**

**Descriptive Statistics** is a methods which visualizes and summarize a
set of data in order to understand characteristics of data. The data can
be either a population or a sample.

**Inferential Statistics** is a methos which infers characteristics of a
population using the sample data or test hypothesis on the population
characteristics using the sample data.

In order to study the Data Science in depth, additional study for
advanced theories in Statistics, Mathematics and Computer Science are
necessary. A computer software is essential for practicing Data Science,
but it is not easy to learn a high level statistical software which
requires understanding of a computer language. Authors have developed a
web based software called 『eStat』 which has user friendly interface
especially for beginners. 『eStat』 also includes many useful dynamic
graphical tools for visualizing data and many simulation experiments to
explain complicated statistical theories. All theories of each chapter
in this book can be practiced using 『eStat』.

Chapters 2, 3, and 4 of this book discuss methods of the descriptive
statistics. Chapter 2 discusses visualizations of Qualitative Data such
as bar graph, pie chart, band chart, and line graph. Chapter 3 discusses
visualizations of quantitative data such as histogram, stem and leaf
plot, box plot, and scatter plot. Chapter 4 introduces methods of data
summary by using tables and measures. Any middle school student or more
are able to study these chapters

Chapters 5 to 12 of this book describe methods of the inferential
statistics. Chapter 5 introduces concept of probability and the
probability distribution models for both discrete and continuous data
such as Binomial, Poisson, Hypergeometric and Normal distribution.
Chapter 6 discusses relationship between sample and population, and
explains the sampling distribution of the sample statistics. It
introduces the estimation of the population parameters using the
sampling distributions. These chapters are fundamentals for the
inferential statistics.

Chapters 7 to 9 describe the parametric hypothesis tests for continuous
data. Chapter 7 discusses the testing hypothesis for parameters of
single population such as population mean, population variance and
population proportion. Chapter 8 discusses the testing hypothesis for
parameters of two populations such as two population means, two
population variances and two population proportions. Chapter 9 discusses
the testing hypothesis for parameters of several populations such as the
analysis of variances.

Chapter 10 describes the nonparametric hypothesis test for continuous or
ordinal data which includes tests for single location parameter, two
location parameters and several location parameters. Chapter 11
describes the testing hypothesis for categorical data which includes the
goodness of fit test and the independence test.

Chapter 12 describes the correlation analysis and the regression
analysis of two continuous variables and then introduces the multiple
regression model.

This book is intended to be used for a course of two semesters in
introductory statistics and data science. In this case, Chapter 1 to
Chapter 7 can be covered for the first semester and Chapter 8 to 9 for
the second semester. If it is a single semester course of introductory
statistics, it is recommended to study from Chapter 1 to Chapter 5,
sections of 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, and then 12.1. 『eStat』 is so
helpful for teaching/learning statistics, for example, students do not
need to spend much time for studying the probability distributions as
they do in the old textbooks by looking tables at the back. Therefore,
students are able to study various statistical methods by using
『eStat』 within a single semester.

## 1.3 Variables and Data

::: presentation-video-link
[presentation](0103.pdf){.presentation-link target="_blank"}

::: mainTable
Data are a collection of values or characters which are observed or
measured on interesting characteristics from one person or object to
another. The characteristic that varies from one person or object to
another is called a variable. For example, if you examined gender and
height for college students, there are two variables, gender and height.
A measurement for gender can be in the form of \'Male\' or \'Female\'
and its data can be \'Female\', \'Male\', 'Female', \... , etc which are
a collection of characters. A measurement for height can be 180cm or
170cm and its data are a collection of numerical numbers such as 180cm,
165cm, 158cm, 175cm, \... , etc.

Variables such as gender, marital status, and eye color are called
qualitative variables, also called categorical variables which yield
non-numerical qualitative data or Qualitative Data. Variables such as
height, weight, and years of education are called quantitative variables
which yield numerical quantitative data. Values of a qualitative
variable are sometimes coded with numbers, for example, zip codes which
represent geographical locations. We can not do arithmetic with such
numbers as zip codes, in contrast to those of a quantitative variable.

Quantitative variables can be classified as either discrete or
continuous. A discrete variable is a variable whose possible values can
be countable which imply either finite or countably infinite. A discrete
variable usually involves a count of something, such as the number of
cars owned by a family, or the number of students in an introductory
statistics class. A continuous variable is a variable whose possible
values are uncountable real numbers. Typically, a continuous variable
involves a measurement of something, such as the age of a person, the
weight of a newborn baby, or the fuel mileage of a car. If we measure
the height of a student, we usually write it with an integer value such
as 180cm which looks like a finite number. But the height is not a
discrete variable, because 180cm is an approximation of actual real
number such as 180.123456 and therefore the height is a continuous
variable.

Quantitative data can be transformed to categorical data by dividing all
possible values of a quantitative variable into non-overlapped
intervals. For example, age data can be transformed to categorical data
by using a transformation such as 'less than 30', '30 \~ \<40)', '40 \~
\<60', 'greater than 60'.

Types of variables are summarized graphically in \<Figure 1.3.1\> and
verbally in the following definition
:::

**Example 1.3.1** A survey for 30 students in a college was conducted to
examine gender, height and weight. What are variables of this survey and
classfy the type of each variable.

**Answer**

This survey examines three characteristics of each student, gender,
height and weights and these characteristics are called variables.

Gender can be either male or female and is called a qualitative variable
or a categorical variable.

Height and weight can be any numerical value and are called a
quantitative value. Since possible values of height and weight can be
any real number, they are called continuous variables.

Data are values of a variable. Depending on the type of a variable, data
can be classified either qualitative or quantitative. If data are
quantitative, it can be classified either discrete or continuous. Types
of data are summarized verbally in the following definition
:::

::: mainTableYellow
**Data**

**Data**: Values of a variable.

**Qualitative (Categorical) data**: Values of a qualitative variable.

**Quantitative data**: Values of a quantitative variable.

**Discrete data**: Values of a discrete variable.

**Continuous data**: Values of a continuous variable.
:::

::: mainTable
Each individual piece of data is called an observation, and the
collection of all observations for a particular variable is called a
data set, but sometimes it is called simply called data.

Understanding of data types is essential to apply an appropriate
statistical method for data. Method of processing data and its
statistical analysis are different depending on the type of data.
Chapter 2 of this book introduces the visualization of qualitative data,
while Chapter 3 introduces the visualization of quantitative data.
Chapter 4 discusses frequency tables and contingency tables which are
the summaries of qualitative data, and also discusses tables and summary
measures for quantitative data. Chapters 5 - 10 and Chapter 12 discuss
theories of statistical analysis for quantitative data. Chapter 11
discusses theory of analysis for categorical data.

In order to do data analysis using software, the qualitative data can be
divided into either raw data or frequency table data. For example, ten
students in an elementary school are examined based on their gender such
as follows.

male, female, male, female, male, male, male, female, female, male.

This data is referred to as the raw data of the gender variable and can
be arranged in a single column of Excel sheet as Table 1.3.1.

  10    male

We can give a name of this column as \'Gender\' which is called a
variable name and their possible values, 'male' and 'female', are called
values of the variable or value labels.

If you count the number of male students and female students in Table
1.3.1, there are six male students and four female students and can be
summarized as Table 1.3.2. These frequency data are called the frequency
table data of the gender variable and it is called a frequency table.
Excel typically uses this kind of frequency table data for their graphs.

Table 1.3.2 frequency table data for the gender of a class

  Gender   Number of Students
  -------- --------------------
  Male     6
  Female   4

Types of data are summarized graphically in \<Figure 1.3.2\>.

The development of computers has greatly influenced the rapid use of
statistics in various fields. This is because computers are able to
process complex calculations of many data for statistical methods in a
short time. Many useful statistical methods which were previously
considered impossible to practice become to be feasible for practical
use.

A software specialized in many statistical analysis is called the
statistical package and it is essential to apply statistical methods for
practical use. In the 1960s, SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences) was first developed and used for the National Opinion Research
Center in the U.S. Since then many statistical packages such as S, BMDP,
SAS, Statistica, Stata, Minitab, etc have been developed. SAS and SPSS
still have large market share worldwide and have evolved for the big
data analysis, but they are commercial and very expensive. In the 1990s,
Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman (University of Auckland in New Zealand)
developed an open source system R and allowed users to develop their own
specialized package by using R core functions. Nowadays, R becomes to
have so many useful and specialized package for advanced statistical
analysis. R is a widely used statistical package for analyzing big data
as well as traditional statistical analysis.

analysis. It is essential for mass data processing

Examples: SPSS, SAS, R, STATA, eStat

However, these statistical packages are not easy for beginners to learn
and very expensive except R. Also, these statistical packages have very
little specialized modules required for statistics education. There are
some softwares for statistics education, but they are not able to
process data or have limited functions. Also, there is no comprehensive
software for statistics education to all levels of students in
elementary, middle, high school and college.

『eStat』 is a statistical package and designed to teach statistics
easily for all levels of students from elementary school to college and
even for general public. 『eStat』 is a web-based freeware package, so
users can use it anytime and anywhere using PC, tablet, or mobile phone
with free of charge. It has been translated into more than 20
multinational languages. 『eStat』 has a user friendly interface which
can draw a dynamic graph by just clicking mouse. 『eStat』 can not only
process data as a statistical package, but also enable users to practice
various simulations to understand statistical theories such as binomial
experiment, law of large number, central limit theorem, interval
estimation and regression analysis. It includes many examples for all
level of students.
