**CHAPTER OBJECTIVES**

Estimation of population parameters using sample distributions was
discussed in Chapter 6.

However, one might be interested in which one of two hypothesis about
the population parameter is reasonable to accept.

This problem is called a testing hypothesis and we take samples and
calculate the sample statistics to decide by using the sampling
distributions discussed in Chapter 6.

In this chapter we discuss the testing hypothesis of the population
mean, population variance and population proportion.

A method of testing hypothesis which considers both type 1 and type 2
error is also introduced.

Examples of testing hypothesis for a population mean are as follows.

::: textL30M10
- The weight of a cookie bag is indicated as 200g. Would there be
enough cookies as the indicated weight?

- At a light bulb factory, a newly developed light bulb advertises a
longer bulb life than the past one. Is this propaganda reliable?

- Immediately after completing this year's academic test, students
said that there will be 5 points increase in the average English score
higher than last year. How can you investigate if this is true?

Testing hypothesis is the answer to the above questions (hypothesis).
That is, the testing hypothesis is to decide statistically which
hypothesis is to use for the two hypotheses about the unknown population
parameter using samples. In this section, we examine the test of the
population mean, population variance, and population proportion which
are most commonly used in testing hypothesis.

The following example explains the theory of testing hypothesis of the
population mean in single population.

**Example 7.1.1** At a light bulb factory, the average life expectancy
of a light bulb made by a conventional production method is known to be
1500 hours and the standard deviation is 200 hours. Recently, the
company is trying to introduce a new production method, with the average
life expectancy of 1600 hours for light bulbs. To confirm this argument,
30 samples were taken from the new type of light bulbs by simple random
sampling and the sample mean was $\overline x$ = 1555 hours. Can you
tell me that the new type of light bulb has the average life of 1600
hours?

**Answer**

A statistical approach to the question of this issue is first to make
two assumptions about the different arguments for the population mean μ
. Namely, $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft H_0 : μ = 1500 \\ 
        \shoveleft H_1 : μ = 1600
        \end{multline}
      $$ $\small H_0$ is called a null hypothesis and $\small H_1$ is an
alternative hypothesis. In most cases, the null hypothesis is defined as
an 'existing known fact', and the alternative hypothesis is defined as
'new facts or changes in current beliefs'. So when choosing between two
hypotheses, the basic idea of testing hypothesis is 'unless there is a
significant reason, we accept the null hypothesis (current fact) without
choosing the alternative hypothesis (the fact of the matter). This idea
of testing hypothesis is referred to as a 'conservative decision
making'.

A common sense criterion for choosing between two hypotheses would be
'which population mean of two hypothesis is closer in distance to the
sample mean'. Based on this common sense criteria which uses the
concept of distance, the sample mean of 1555 is closer to
$\small H_1 : μ = 1600$ so the alternative hypothesis will be chosen. A
statistical testing hypothesis is based not only on this common sense
criteria, but also on the sampling distribution of $\overline X$. In
other words, the statistical testing hypothesis is to select a critical
value $C$ based on the sampling distribution theory and to make a
decision rule as follows:

$\small  \qquad \text { ‘If \(\overline X$ is smaller than C, then the
null hypothesis $H_0$ will be chosen, else reject $H_0$'} \\)

The area of {$\small \overline X < C$} is called an acceptance region of
$\small H_0$ and the area {$\small \overline X ≥ C$} is called a
rejection region of $\small H_0$ ([Figure 7.1.1]{.figure-ref}).

![](Figure/Fig070101.png){.imgFig400300}

::: figText
[Figure 7.1.1]{.figure-ref} Acceptance and rejection region of $H_{0}$
:::

If a hypothesis is chosen by this decision rule, there are always two
possible errors in the decision. One is a **Type 1 Error** which accepts
$\small H_1$ when $\small H_0$ is true, the other is a **Type 2 Error**
which accept $\small H_0$ when $\small H_1$ is true. These errors can be
summarized as [Table 7.1.1]{.table-ref}.

Table 7.1.1 Two types of errors in testing hypothesis

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Actual\                 Actual\
                          $\small H_0$ is true    $\small H_1$ is true
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Decision : $\small H_0$ Correct                 Type 2 Error
  is true                                         

  Decision : $\small H_1$ Type 1 Error            Correct
  is true                                         
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you try to reduce one type of error when the sample size is fixed,
then the other type of error is increasing. That is why we came up with
a conservative decision making method that defines the null hypothesis
$\small H_0$ as 'past or present facts' and 'accept the null
hypothesis unless there is a significance evidence for the alternative
hypothesis.' In this conservative way, we try to reduce the type 1
error as much as possible that selects $\small H_1$ when $\small H_0$ is
true, which would be more risky than the type 2 error. Testing
hypothesis determines the tolerance for the probability of the type 1
error, usually 5% or 1% for rigorous test, and use the selection
criteria that satisfy this limitation. The tolerance for the probability
that this type 1 error will occur is called the **significance level**
and is often expressed as α. The probability of the type 2 error is
expressed as β.

If the significance level is established, the decision rule for the two
hypotheses can be tested using the sampling distribution of all possible
sample means in Chapter 6. [Figure 7.1.2]{.figure-ref} shows the distribution of
populations for two hypotheses, and the distribution of all possible
sample means for each population.

![](Figure/Fig070102.png){.imgFig400300}

::: figText
[Figure 7.1.2]{.figure-ref} Testing Hypothesis
:::

If the population corresponds to the distribution of $\small H_0$ : μ =
1500, the sampling distribution of all possible sample means is
approximated as $\small N(1500,200^2 )$ by the central limit theorem. If
the population corresponds to the distribution of $\small H_1$ : μ =
1600, the sampling distribution of all possible sample means is
approximated as $\small N(1600,200^2 )$. The standard deviation for each
population is assumed to be 200 from a historical data. Then the
decision rule becomes as follows:

$\small  \qquad \text {‘If \(\overline X < C$, then accept $H_{0}$, else
accept $H_{1}$ (i.e. reject $H_{0}$ )'} \\)

In Figure 7.1.2, the shaded area represents the probability of the type
1 error. If we set the significance level, which is the tolerance level
of the type 1 error, is 5%, i.e. $\small P(\overline X < C) = 0.95$, $C$
can be calculated by finding the percentile of the normal distribution
$\small N(1500,\frac{200^2}{30})$ as follows:

$\small  \qquad 1560+1.645 \frac{200}{\sqrt 30 } = 1560.06$

Therefore, the decision rule can be written as follows.

$\small  \qquad \text {‘If \(\overline X$ \< 1560.06, then accept $H_0$,
else reject $H_0$ (accept $H_1$ ).'} \\)

In this problem, the observed sample mean of the random variable
$\small \overline X$ is $\overline x$= 1555 and $\small H_0$ is
accepted. In other words, the hypothesis of $\small H_0$ : μ = 1500 is
judged to be correct, which contradicts the result of common sense
criteria that $\overline x$ = 1555 is closer to $\small H_1$ : μ = 1600
than $\small H_0$ : μ = 1500. This result can be interpreted that the
sample mean of 1555 is not a sufficient evidence to reject the null
hypothesis by a conservative decision making method.

The above decision rule is often written as follows, emphasizing that it
is the result from a conservative decision making method.

$\small  \qquad \text {‘If \(\overline X$ \< 1560.06, then do not reject
$H_0$, else reject $H_0$.'} \\)

In addition, this decision rule can be written for calculation purpose
as follows.

$\small  \qquad \text {‘If \(\frac{\overline X - 1500}{\frac {200}{\sqrt{30}}}$,
then accept $H_0$ , else reject $H_0$.'} \\)

In this case, since $\overline x$ = 1555,
$\frac{1555 - 1500}{\frac {200}{\sqrt{30}}}$ and it is less than 1.645.
Therefore, we accept $\small H_0$.
:::

::: mainTable
Since the testing hypothesis by the conservative decision making is only
based on the probability of the type 1 error as seen in \[Example
7.1.1\], even if the alternative hypothesis is $H_1 : μ > 1500$, we will
have the same decision rule.

Generally, there are three types of alternative hypothesis in the
testing hypothesis for the population mean as follows. $$ 
        \begin{align}
          & 1)\quad H_1 : \mu \gt \mu_0  \\
          & 2)\quad H_1 : \mu \gt \mu_0  \\
          & 3)\quad H_1 : \mu \ne \mu_0  \\
        \end{align}
      $$ Since 1) has the rejection region on the right side of the
sampling distribution of all possible sample means under the null
hypothesis, it is called a **right-sided test**. Since 2) has the
rejection region on the left side of the sampling distribution, it is
called a **left-sided test**. Since 3) has rejection regions on both
sides of the sampling distribution, it is called a **two-sided test**.
The decision rule for each type of three alternative hypothesis are
summarized in [Table 7.1.2]{.table-ref} when the population standard deviation is
known and α is the significance level.

::: mainTable
The following expression used for the decision rule is referred to as a
test statistic for testing hypothesis of the population mean. $$
        \frac {\overline X - \mu_0}{ \frac {\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} }
      $$

The population standard deviation σ of the test statistic is usually
unknown. However, if the sample is large enough (approximately 30 or
more), the hypothesis test can be performed using the sample standard
deviation $S$ instead of the population standard deviation σ.

In [Example 7.1.1]{.example-ref}, if the sample mean is either 1555 or 1540, the
null hypothesis can not be rejected, but degrees of evidence that the
null hypothesis is not rejected are different. The degree of evidence
that the null hypothesis is not rejected is measured by calculating the
probability of the type 1 error when the observed sample mean value is
considered as the critical value for decision, which is called the
$p$-value. That is, the $p$-value indicates where the observed sample
mean is located among all possible sample means by considering the
location of the alternative hypothesis. In [Example 7.1.1]{.example-ref}, the
$p$-value for $\overline X$ = 1540 is the probability of sample means
which is greater than $\overline X$ = 1540 by using
$N(1500, \frac{200^2}{30} )$. The higher the $p$-value, the stronger the
reason for not being rejected. If $H_0$ is rejected, the smaller the
$p$-value, the stronger the grounds for being rejected. Therefore, if
the $p$-value is less than the significance level considered by the
analyst, then $H_0$ is rejected, because it means that the sample mean
is in the rejection region. Statistical packages provide this $p$-value.

Since the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size
is small, the decision rule is as follows. $$ \small

$\frac {253 - 250}{ \frac {10}{\sqrt{16}} } = 1.2$, and
$t_{15: 0.01} = 2.602$ , we accept $\small H_0$. Note that the decision
rule can be written as follows.

$\small  \qquad \qquad\text{'If } \overline X > 250 + 2.602 \frac {10}{\sqrt{16}} , \text{ then reject } H_0 \text{ else accept } H_0 ’ \\ $

The testing hypothesis of the population mean using the sample variance
requires the assumption that the population is normally distributed.
Testing whether sample data come from a normal population is called a
goodness of fit test which will be explained in Chapter 11.

In this section, we looked at the testing hypothesis for the population
mean when the sample size is already given and only consider the
significance level of the type 1 error. In this case, if we try to
reduce the probability of the type 1 error, then the probability of the
type 2 error will be increased and we can not reduce both types of
errors at the same time. Therefore, if the sample size was
predetermined, or if data were given, only the type 1 error was
considered as a conservative decision making to test the hypothesis.
However, if the sample size can be selected by a researcher, there is a
testing hypothesis that considers both types of errors together which
will be explained in detail in section 7.4.

Examples for testing hypothesis of a population variance are as follows.

::: textL30M10
- Bolts produced by a company are currently supplied to an automaker
and have an average diameter of 7mm and a variance of 0.25mm. Recently,
a rival company has applied for the supply, claiming that their
company's bolts have the same average diameter of 7 mm but a variance
of 0.16mm. How can I find out if this claim is true?

- The variance of scores in mathematics on the last year's college
scholastic aptitude test was 100. Questions in mathematics this year's
test are said to be much easier than last year's. How can I test
whether the variance of the mathematics score in this year is smaller
than the last year?
:::

If you understand the testing hypothesis for the population mean, the
testing hypothesis for the population variance differs only from the
sampling distribution and the test statistic, and the basic concept is
the same. In Chapter 6, we studied that the distribution of all possible
sample variances multiplied by a constant, $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}$,
follows a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom when the
population is a normal distribution with variance $\sigma^2$. Using this
theory, testing hypothesis for the population variance can be done as
follows.
:::

- the population is normally distributed -

  $\quad\,\, H_1 : \sigma^{2} < \sigma^{2}_0$     then reject $H_0$, else accept $H_0$

  3\) $\; H_0 : \sigma^{2} = \sigma^{2}_0$\       If $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} > \chi^2_{n-1: α/2}$
  $\quad\,\, H_1 : \sigma^{2} \ne \sigma^{2}_0$   or
                                                  $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} < \chi^2_{n-1: 1-α/2}$

Since the testing hypothesis we have learned so far is a conservative
decision making method, we first decide a critical value that reduces
the probability of the type 1 error α (the error that rejects the null
hypothesis even though it is true). This decision rule is intended to
keep the null hypothesis unless there is a sufficient evidence of the
alternative hypothesis which is a new fact or risky. Thus, the
probability of the type 2 error β was not considered at all in the
decision rule. However, sometimes it is unclear which one should be the
null hypothesis and which one should be the alternative hypothesis.
Depending on the problem, both types of errors are important and should
be considered simultaneously. If the analyst can determine the sample
size, a testing hypothesis that takes into account both α and β can be
performed.
:::

### Type 2 Error and Power of a Test

::: mainTable
Consider the following example to find out how to calculate the
probability of the type 2 error β.
:::

::: mainTableGrey
**Example 7.4.1** For the testing hypothesis of [Example 7.1.1]{.example-ref},
calculate the probability of the type 2 error β if the significance
level is 5%. Check this result using 『eStatU』.

**Answer**

The hypothesis in [Example 7.1.1]{.example-ref} is
$\small H_0 : \mu = 1500, H_1 : \mu = 1600$, the population standard
deviation is assumed σ = 200, the sample size is $n$ = 30 and hence the
decision rule is as follows if the significance level is 5%.

$\small  \qquad '\text{If } \overline X \lt 1500 + 1.645 \times \frac {200}{30} = 1560.06, \text{ reject } H_0,\text{ else accept } H_0’$

Hence the type 2 error which is the probability of '$\small H_0$ is
true when $\small H_1$ is true' can be calculated as follows:

$\small \qquad \beta = P(\overline X \lt 1560.06 | H_1$ is true)\
$\small \qquad \;\; = P(\frac {\overline X - 1600}{\frac{200}{\sqrt{30}} } < \frac {1560.06 - 1600}{\frac{200}{\sqrt{30}} } )$\
$\small \qquad \;\; = P( Z \lt -1.09 )$\
$\small \qquad \;\; = 0.137$

Select 'Testing $\mu - C, \beta$ ' at 『eStatU』 menu. Enter
$\small \mu_0 = 1500 , \mu_1 = 1600,  \sigma = 200, \alpha = 0.05, n = 30$
in the input box window as [Figure 7.4.1]{.figure-ref} and click the [Execute]{.button-ref}
button. The result of the testing hypothesis, the critical value $C$ and
the probability of the type 2 error β, will be shown as in \<Figure
7.4.2\>.

::: mainTable
Comparing [Example 7.4.1]{.example-ref} and [Example 7.4.2]{.example-ref}, the probability of
the type 2 error occurring when $H_1 : \mu = 1600$ is less than that of
$H_1 : \mu = 1580$, so the ability to judge is greater. In other words,
the closer the population mean of $H_1$ is to the population mean of
$H_0$, the less discriminating ability it becomes.

Generally, the discriminating ability of two hypothesis is compared by
using the following **power of a test**. $$ 
        \text {Power = 1 - (probability of the type 2 error) = 1 - } \beta
      $$ A large power increases the discriminating ability of the
hypothesis test.

The power of a test can be obtained for any $\mu_1$ of the alternative
hypothesis $H_1 : \mu = \mu_1$. It means that the power is a function
over the value of $\mu_1$ and it is called a **power function**.

A function of the probability that the null hypothesis is correct when
the null hypothesis is true is called an **operating characteristic
function**. $$ 
        \text {Operatiing characteristic function = 1 - (probability of the type 1 error) = 1 - }\alpha

**Answer**

Although the alternative hypotheses are different, the decision rule is
the same as follows:

$\qquad \small '\text{If } \overline X \lt 1500 + 1.645 \times \frac {200}{30} = 1560.06, \text{ reject } H_0,\text{ else accept } H_0’$

Hence if we calculate the probability of the type 2 error as \[Example
7.4.2\], the power of each test is as follows:

### Testing Hypothesis with α and β

::: mainTable
If the sample size is not predetermined and the analyst can determine
it, the testing hypothesis can be performed with the desired level of α
and β as following example.
:::

::: mainTableGrey
**Example 7.4.4** Consider the testing hypothesis on the bulb life such
as $\small H_0 : \mu = 1500, H_1 : \mu = 1570$. Find the sample size $n$
and the decision rule which satisfies α of 5% and β of 10%. Assume that
the population standard deviation σ is 200 hours. Check the result using
『eStatU』.

**Answer**

Let $n$ be the sample size and $\small C$ be the critical value of a
decision rule. The probability of the type 1 error α and the probability
of the type 2 error β are defined as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \alpha = P(\overline X \gt C | H_0 \text{ is true } ) \\
        \shoveleft \beta = P(\overline X \lt C | H_1 \text{ is true } ) \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ If $\small H_0$ is true, the sampling distribution of
$\small \overline X$ is $\small N(1500, \frac{200^2}{n})$ and if
$\small H_1$ is true, the sampling distribution of $\small \overline X$
is $\small N(1570, \frac{200^2}{n})$. If α = 0.05 and β = 0.10, then
$z_{0.05}$ = 1.645 and $z_{0.90}$ = -1.280. Hence $n$ and $\small C$
should satisfy both of the following equations and they can be
calculated by solving the two system of equations. $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft C = 1500 + 1.645 \times \frac{200}{\sqrt{n}} \\
        \shoveleft C = 1570 - 1.280 \times \frac{200}{\sqrt{n}} \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ The solution is $n$ = 69.8, $\small C$ = 1539.4. i.e., the
sample size is 70 approximately and the decision rule is as follows:
$$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft '\text{If } \overline X \gt 1539.4, \text { then reject } H_0, \text { else accept } H_0’
        \end{multline}
      $$ Select 'Testing μ - $C, n$' at 『eStatU』 menu. Enter
$\mu_0 = 1500 ,\mu_1 = 1570 , \alpha = 0.05$, $\beta = 0.10$ in the
input box window as [Figure 7.4.4]{.figure-ref}.

7.7 In a large manufacturer, the manager of the company claims that the
average adaptation score of all unskilled workers is greater than 60. In
order to check this claim, 40 unskilled workers were randomly selected
and their test scores of adaptation scores were as follows.

7.8 Existing tires of a company have an average life span of 54,000 km
and a standard deviation of 10,000 km. Two researchers conducted a
performance test for new tires independently. The first researcher
tested 25 tires and obtained an average life span of 48,000 km, while
the second researcher tested 100 to get 50,000 km. Which test result
gives more reliable statistical evidence that the average life span of a
new tire is less than the existing one? Assume that the standard
deviation has not changed.

7.12 If the variance of diameters of metal washer products is less than
$0.000005^2$, then the production process is under control. 31 samples
were randomly selected from the assembly line and its variance is
$0.000006^2$. According to this data, is the assembly process out of
control with the significance level of 0.05? What assumptions do you
need to get an answer?

7.13 For a manufacturer to make a product, the variance of tensile
strength of the synthetic fiber must be less than or equal to five. When
25 samples are randomly selected from the new shipment and the variance
is seven. Does this data provide sufficient evidence for the
manufacturer to reject the shipment? Assume the significance level of
0.05 and that the tensile strength of the fiber follows approximately a

7.19 A high school student made dice from wood. It doesn't look like a
cube, so it's not one-sixth of a chance of six at the top. I rolled the
dice 18,000 times and got 3,126 of six at the top.
:::

::: textL50M30
1\) Determine whether these 3126 occurrences are statistically
significant by obtaining the $p-value$.
:::

::: textL50M30
2\) Since it is too much to demand that a hand-made dice have an exact
one-sixth chance of producing six, we decided to allow the error of 0.01
chance to be a fair dice. Using the above sample experiment, obtain a
confidence interval for the probability of a 6 and determine whether it
is acceptable to be viewed as a fair dice (Note: It is difficult to
distinguish between the statistical significance and the practical
significance by relying solely on testing hypothesis.)
