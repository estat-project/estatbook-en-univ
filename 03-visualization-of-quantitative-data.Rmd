## CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

In this chapter, we introduce graphs to visualize the quantitative data
such as dot graph, histogram, stem and leaf plot and scatter plot.

In Section 3.2, we discuss visualization of single quantitative variable
using 『eStat』. Visualization of the quantitative data both without
group and with group is discussed.

In Section 3.3, we discuss visualization of two quantitative variables
using the scatter plot of 『eStat』.

Data such as height and weight whose possible values are real numbers
are called quantitative data. In order to visualize the quantitative
data of a variable, a dot graph, a histogram, a stem and leaf plot are
used. In order to visualize the quantitative data of two variables, a
scatter plot which utilizes two-dimensional coordinate is used.

![](Icon/eStat_icon13_dot.png){.imgIcon}\
A dot graph is used to visualize the quantitative data with smaller
number of data counts. In order to draw the dot graph, we first draw the
horizontal line and set its scale so that all data can be displayed on
the horizontal line by considering minimum and maximum of the data, then
mark each of the data values in dot corresponding to its scale. The dot
graph makes it easy to see distribution patterns and anomalies of the
data.

![](Icon/eStat_icon14_histo.png){.imgIcon} If there are too many
observations of the quantitative data and therefore there are too many
possible values of the data, the dot graph may not have enough space to
show all data. In such cases, we divide usually all possible values of
the data into several intervals and count the number of data belonging
to each of intervals. Using the frequencies of each interval, we draw a
histogram which is similar to the bar graph with no spacing between
bars.

You might ask a question, \'How many intervals do I need to have?\'
There is no exact answer for the number of intervals, but 52 number of
intervals is usually used when there are small number of data. A square
root of the number of data is also often used as the number of
intervals, but, if the number of intervals is too many, it is not easy
to analyze the data sometimes. As far as the number of intervals is
concerned, it depends on the analyst\'s judgement.

![](Icon/eStat_icon15_stem.png){.imgIcon}\
A stem and leaf plot is a variation of the histogram which is recently
used to visualize the quantitative data. The stem and leaf plot can
easily tell range of observations, shape of distribution, and
concentration. The name literally shows the data in the form of stems
and leaves by considering digits of data values, the first few digits
form the stems and the remaining digits form the leaves. In 『eStat』 ,
the last digit of the data values forms the leaves and the digits in
front of them forms the stems. For each number of the data, first we
investigate where it belongs to a stem and then write down the last
digit of the number as a leaf corresponding to the stem. After
investigating all numbers in the data, rearrange the values of the
leaves on each stem in ascending order. The stem and leaf plot have been
commonly used in recent years as both an interval-specific frequency
distribution and a histogram for the quantitative data.

![](Icon/eStat_icon17_scatter.png){.imgIcon}\
A Scatter plot is to visualize data of two quantitative variables using
two dimensional coordinates. The scatter plot can be considered as an
extension of the dot graph for single quantitative variable. Each pair
of the data of two quantitative variables is expressed as a dot with one
value on the X-axis and the other value on the Y-axis in the XY plane.
By using the scatter plot, relationship between two quantitative
variables can be observed efficiently.

In this chapter, visualization of the quantitative data is discussed by
separating cases of the data without group and with group. Visualization
of the quantitative data is a basic step of statistical analysis that
will be described over the next chapters 7 to 12. It is an exploratory
data analysis before you get into some statistical analysis. Estimation
and testing hypothesis for the quantitative data of single population
are described in Chapter 6 and 7. Testing hypothesis for the
quantitative data of two populations are described in Chapter 8. Testing
hypothesis for the quantitative data of three or more populations are
described in Chapter 9.

**Graphs for Quantitative Data**

**Dot graph** marks each of the data values in dot on a horizontal line
corresponding to its scale. The dot graph makes it easy to see
distribution patterns and anomalies of the data.

**Histogram** divides all possible data values into several intervals,
count the number of data belonging to each interval, and draws a bar
graph using this frequencies with no spacing between bars.

**Stem and leaf plot** is a variation of the histogram which is recently
used to visualize quantitative data. The stem and leaf plot shows the
data in the form of stems and leaves by considering digits of data
values, the first few digits form the stems and the remaining digits
form the leaves.

**Scatter plot** is to visualize the data of two quantitative variables
using two dimensional coordinates. The scatter plot can be considered as
an extension of the dot graph.

In case of the quantitative data, raw data are directly used to
visualize the data. Visualization of the quantitative data is discussed
by separating cases of the data without group and with group.

### 3.2.1 Visualization of Quantitative Data without Group

::: mainTable
If the quantitative data are the sample data from a population,
visualization of this sample data is used as a basic exploratory data
analysis for estimation and testing hypothesis of population parameters
such as population mean and population variance (Chapters 6 and 7).

### 3.2.2 Visualization of Quantitative Data with Group

::: mainTable
If you can visualize the quantitative data by several groups using the
same scale, it is easy to compare characteristics of groups. If the data
are the sample data taken from two or more populations (groups), this
comparison by visualization can be used as a basic exploratory data
analysis for testing hypothesis in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9.

If you click on the stem and leaf plot icon
![](Icon/eStat_icon15_stem.png){.imgIcon}, the graph as in
\<Figure 3.2.13\> will be displayed in the Graph Area. This stem and
leaf plot is a variant of the histogram in which the age data are
divided into intervals as \[20, 30), \[30, 40), \... \[60,70) by using
the possible decimal digits of 10s as the stem. The age data belonging
to each interval are investigated and displayed using the last digit of
the age as the leaf. The last digits (leaf) of the age are sorted in
ascending order from small to large.

In case of two groups, a bi-lateral stem and leaf plot as in \<Figure

In general, we investigate several characteristics from one subject or
one observation. For example, when we investigate students in an
elementary school, we examine their gender, height and weight
simultaneously which are one categorical and two quantitative variables.

If you have data on two quantitative variables, a scatter plot can be
used to analyze the data. A scatter plot displays the data on a
two-dimensional plane with values for one variable being X-axis and
values for the other being Y-axis. If a categorical variable such as
gender is also collected together, a scatter plot by differenciating the
colors of the dots by gender can be drawn.

If data are sampled from a population, the scatter plot can be used to
analyze correlation and regression which will be discussed in Chapter
12.

scatter plot, you can see that the larger the height, the heavier the
weight is. See Chapter 12 for more discussion on the regression
analysis.

By checking the \'Regression\' in the options window below the graph
shows a scatter plot with a regression line as in \<Figure 3.3.2\> which
indicates a relationship between weight and height. If you look at the
scatter plot, you can see that the larger the height, the heavier the
