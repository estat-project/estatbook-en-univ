## CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

The hypothesis tests that we have studied from Chapter 7 to Chapter 10
are for continuous data. In this chapter, we describe testing hypothesis
for categorical data.

Section 11.1 describes the goodness of fit test for the frequency table
of categorical data.

Section 11.2 describes the independence and homogeneity tests for the
contingence table of two categorical data.

::: mainTable
The frequency table of categorical data discussed in Chapter 4 counts
the frequency of possible values of a categorical variable. If this
frequency table is for sample data from a population, we are curious
what would be the frequency distribution of the population. The goodness
of fit test is a test on the hypothesis that the population follows a
particular distribution based on the sample frequency distribution. In
this section, we discuss the goodness of fit test for categorical
distributions (Section 11.1.1) and the goodness of fit test for
continuous distribution (Section 11.1.2).
:::

### 11.1.1 Goodness of Fit Test for Categorical Distribution

::: mainTable
Consider the goodness of fit test for a categorical distribution using
the example below.
:::

::: mainTableGrey
**Example 11.1.1** The result of a survey of 150 people before a local
election to find out the approval ratings of three candidates is as
follows. Looking at this frequency table alone, it seems that A
candidate has a 40 percent approval rating, higher than the other
candidates. Based on this sample survey, perform the goodness of fit
test whether three candidates have the same approval rating or not.
Use『eStatU』with the 5% significance level.

::: textLeft
Table 11.1.1 Frequency table of survey result in an election.
:::

  Candidate   Number of Supporters   Percent
  ----------- ---------------------- ---------
  A           60                     40.0％
  B           50                     33.3％
  C           40                     25.7％
  Total       150                    100%

**Answer**

Assume each of candidate A, B, and C's approval rating is
$p_1 , p_2 , p_3$ respectively. The hypothesis for this problem is as
follows:

::: textLeft
$\small H_0$ : The three candidates have the same approval rating.
(i.e.,$p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3}$ )
:::

::: textLeft
$\small H_1$ : The three candidates have different approval ratings.
:::

If the null hypothesis $\small H_0$ is true that the three candidates
have the same approval rating, each candidate will have 50 (=
150$\times \frac{1}{3}$ ) supporters out of total 150 people. It is
referred to as the 'expected frequency' of each candidate when
$\small H_0$ is true. For each candidate, the number of observed
supporters in the sample is called the \'observed frequency\'. If
$\small H_0$ is true, the observed and expected number of supporters can
be summarized as the following table.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Candidate               Observed frequency\     Expected frequency\
                          (denoted as $O_i$)      (denoted as $E_i$)
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  A                       $O_1 = 60$              $E_1 = 50$

  B                       $O_2 = 50$              $E_2 = 50$

  C                       $O_3 = 40$              $E_3 = 50$

  Total                   150                     150
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

If $\small H_0$ is true, the observed frequency ($\small O_i$) and the
expected frequency ($\small E_i$) will coincide. Therefore, in order to
test the hypothesis, a statistic which uses the difference between
$\small O_i$ and $\small E_i$ is used. Specifically, the statistic to
test the hypotheses is as follows:

::: textLeft
${\chi}_{obs}^2 = \frac {(O_1 - E_1 )^2} {E_1} + \frac {(O_2 - E_2 ) ^2} {E_2} + \frac {(O_3 - E_3 )^2} {E_3}$
:::

If the observed value of this test statistic is close to zero, it can be
considered that $\small H_0$ is true, because $\small O_i$ is close to
$\small E_i$. If the observed value is large, $\small H_0$ will be
rejected. The question is, \'How large value of the test statistic would
be considered as the statistically significant one?\' It can be shown
that this test statistic approximately follows the chi-square
distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom if the expected frequency is
large enough. Here $k$ is the number of categories (i.e., candidates) in
the table and it is 3 in this example. Therefore, the decision rule to
test the hypotheses is as follows:

::: textLeft
'If $\chi_{obs}^2 > \chi_{k-1; α}^2$ , reject $\small H_0$, else do not
reject $\small H_0$'
:::

The statistic $\chi_{obs}^2$ can be calculated as follows:

::: textLeft
${\chi}_{obs}^2 = \frac {(60 - 50)^2} {50} + \frac {(50 - 50 ) ^2} {50} + \frac {(40 - 50)^2} {50}$
:::

Since the significance level α is 5％, the critical value can be found
from the chi-square distribution as follows:

::: textLeft
$\chi_{k-1 ; α}^{2} = \chi_{3-1 ; 0.05}^{2} = \chi_{2 ; 0.05}^{2} = 5.991$
:::

Therefore, $\small H_0$ can not be rejected. In other words, although
the above sample frequency table shows that the approval ratings of the
three candidates differ, this difference does not provide sufficient
evidence to conclude that the three candidates have different approval
ratings.

Using each candidate\'s sample approval rating
$\hat p_1 = \frac{60}{150}$ = 0.40, $\hat p_2 = \frac{50}{150}$ = 0.33,
$\hat p_1 = \frac{40}{150}$ = 0.27, 95% confidence intervals for the
population proportion of each candidate\'s approval rating using the
formula (${{\hat p}} ± 1.96 \sqrt { \hat p (1- \hat p ) / n }$) (refer
Chapter 6.4) are as follows:

::: textLeft
A:
$\quad 0.40 \pm 1.96 \sqrt { \frac {0.40 \times 0.60} {150} } \quad \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad$
\[0.322, 0.478\]\
B:
$\quad 0.33 \pm 1.96 \sqrt { \frac {0.33 \times 0.67} {150} } \quad \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad$
\[0.255, 0.405\]\
C:
$\quad 0.27 \pm 1.96 \sqrt { \frac {0.27 \times 0.73} {150} } \quad \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad$
\[0.190, 0.330\]\
:::

The overlapping of the confidence intervals on the three candidates\'
approval ratings does not mean that one candidate\'s approval rating is
completely different from the other.

In the Input box that appears by selecting the \'Goodness of Fit Test\'
of 『eStatU』, enter the \'Observed Frequency\' and \'Expected
Probability\' data as shown in \<Figure 11.1.1\>. After entering the
data, select the significance level and click \[Execute\] button to
calculate the \'Expected Frequency\' and to see the result of the
chi-square test. Be sure that this chi-square goodness of fit test
should be applied when the expected frequency of each category is at
least 5.

Consider a categorical variable X which has number of possible values
and their probabilities are respectively. In other words, the
probability distribution for the categorical variable X is as follows:

  $X$        $P(X = x)$
  ---------- ------------
  $x_1$      $p_1$
  $x_2$      $p_2$

When random samples are collected from the population of the categorical
random variable X and their observed frequencies are
($O_1 , O_2 , ... , O_k$), the hypothesis to test the population
probability distribution of ($p_1 , p_2 , ... , p_k$) =
($p_{10} , p_{20} , ... , p_{k0}$) is as follows:

::: textLeft
$H_0$ : Data $O_1 , O_2 , ... , O_k$ are from the distribution
($p_1 , p_2 , ... , p_k$) = ($p_{10} , p_{20} , ... , p_{k0} )$\
$H_1$ : Data $O_1 , O_2 , ... , O_k$ are not from the distribution
($p_1 , p_2 , ... , p_k$) = ($p_{10} , p_{20} , ... , p_{k0} )$\
:::

If the total number of samples $n$ is large enough, the above hypothesis
can be tested using the following decision rule of the chi-square test
statistic. $$

      $$ Here, ($E_1 , E_2 , ... , E_k$) =
($np_{10} , np_{20} , ... , np_{k0}$) are expected frequencies, $m$ is
the number of population parameters estimated from the sample data. In

from the sample, $m$ = 0 .

The goodness of fit test for categorical data using the chi-square
distribution can also be used for continuous data. The following is an
example of the goodness of fit test in which data are derived from a
population of a normal distribution. The parametric statistical tests
from Chapter 6 to Chapter 9 require the assumption that the population
is normally distributed and the goodness of fit test in this section can
be used to test for normality.
:::

::: mainTableGrey
**Example 11.1.2** The age of 30 people who visited a library in the
morning is as follows. Test the hypothesis that the population is
normally distributed at the significance level of 5%.

**Answer**

Age is a continuous variable, but you can make a frequency distribution
by dividing possible values into intervals as we studied in histogram of
Chapter 3. It is called a categorization of the continuous data.

Let\'s find a frequency table which starts at the age of 10 with the
interval size of 10. The histogram of『eStat』makes this frequency table
easy to obtain.

If you enter the data as shown in \<Figure 11.1.3\>, click the histogram
icon and select Age from the variable selection box, then the histogram
as \<Figure 11.1.4\> will appear.

If you specify \'start interval\' as 10 and \'interval width\' as 10 in
the options window below the histogram, the histogram of \<Figure
11.1.4\> is adjusted as \<Figure 11.1.5\>. If you click \[Frequency
Table\] button, the frequency table as shown in \<Figure 11.1.6\> will
appear in the Log Area. The designation of interval size can be
determined by a researcher.

\<Figure 11.1.6\> Frequency table of the adjusted histogram
:::

Since the normal distribution is a continuous distribution defined at
$-\infty \lt x \lt \infty$ , the frequency table of \<Figure 11.1.6\>
can be written as follows:

::: textLeft
Table 11.1.2 Frequency table of age with adjusted interval
:::

  Interval id   Interval          Observed frequency
  ------------- ----------------- --------------------
  1             $X < 20$          2
  2             $20 \le X < 30$   7
  3             $30 \le X < 40$   7
  4             $40 \le X < 50$   9
  5             $50 \le X < 60$   3
  6             $X \ge 60$        2

The frequency table of sample data as Table 11.1.2 can be used to test
the goodness of fit whether the sample data follows a normal
distribution using the chi-square distribution. The hypothesis of this
problem is as follows:

::: textLeft
$\small H_0$ Sample data follows a normal distribution
:::

::: textLeft
$\small H_1$ Sample data does not follow a normal distribution
:::

This hypothesis does not specify what a normal distribution is and
therefore, the population mean $\mu$ and the population variance
$\sigma^2$ should be estimated from sample data. Pressing the \'Basic
Statistics\' icon on the main menu of『eStat』will display a table of
basic statistics in the Log Area, as shown in \<Figure 11.1.7\>. The
sample mean is 38.567 and the sample standard deviation is 12.982.

![](Figure/Fig110107.png){.imgFig600400}

::: figText
\<Figure 11.1.7\> Descriptive statistics of age
:::

Hence, the above hypothesis can be written in detail as follows:

::: textLeft
$\small H_0$ Sample data follows $N(38.567, 12.982^2 )$
:::

::: textLeft
$\small H_1$ Sample data does not follow $N(38.567, 12.982^2 )$
:::

In order to find the expected frequency of each interval when
$\small H_0$ is true, the expected probability of each interval is
calculated first using the normal distribution
$\small N(38.567, 12.982^2 )$ as follows. The normal distribution module
of 『eStatU』 makes it easy to calculate this probability of an
interval. At the normal distribution module of 『eStatU』, enter the
mean of 38.567 and the standard deviation of 12.982. Click the second
radio button of P(X \< x) type and enter 20, then press the \[Execute\]
button to calculate the probability as shown in \<Figure 11.1.8\>.

::: textLeft
$P(X \lt 20) = P(Z \lt \frac {20-38.567} {12.982} ) = P(Z \lt -1.430)=0.075$

Similarly you can calculate the following probabilities.

$P(20 \le X \lt 30) = P(\frac{20-38.567}{12.982} \le Z \lt \frac {30-38.567}{12.982} ) = P(-1.430 \le Z \lt -0.660) = 0.178$
:::

::: textLeft
$P(30 \le X \lt 40) = P(\frac{30-38.567}{12.982} \le Z \lt \frac {40-38.567}{12.982} ) = P(-0.660 \le Z \lt 0.110) = 0.289$
:::

::: textLeft
$P(40 \le X \lt 50) = P(\frac{40-38.567}{12.982} \le Z \lt \frac {50-38.567}{12.982} ) = P( 0.110 \le Z \lt 0.881) = 0.267$
:::

::: textLeft
$P(50 \le X \lt 60) = P(\frac{50-38.567}{12.982} \le Z \lt \frac {60-38.567}{12.982} ) = P( 0.881 \le Z \lt 1.651) = 0.140$
:::

::: textLeft
$P( X \ge 60) = P( Z \ge \frac {60-38.567}{12.982} ) = P( Z \ge 1.651) = 0.049$
:::

Expected frequency can be calculated by multiplying the sample size of
30 to the expected probability of each interval obtained above. The
observed frequencies, expected probabilities, and expected frequencies
for each interval can be summarized as the following table.

Since the expected frequencies of the 1st and 6th interval are less than
5, the intervals should be combined with adjacent intervals for testing
the goodness of fit using the chi-square distribution as Table 11.1.4.
The expected frequency of the last interval is still less than 5, but,
if we combine this interval, there are only three intervals, we
demonstrate the calculation as it is. Note that, due to computational
error, the sum of the expected probabilities may not be exactly equal to
1 and the sum of the expected frequencies may not be exactly 30 in Table
11.1.4.

$\chi_{obs}^{2} = \frac{(9-7.59)^{2}}{7.59} + \frac{(7-8.67)^{2}}{8.67} + \frac{(9-8.01)^{2}}{8.01} + \frac{(5-5.67)^{2}}{5.67} = 0.785$
:::

Since the number of intervals is 4, $k$ becomes 4, and $m$=2, because
two population parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are estimated from the
sample data. Therefore, the critical value is as follows:

::: textLeft
$\chi_{k-m-1; α}^{2} = \chi_{4-2-1; 0.05}^{2} = \chi_{1; 0.05}^{2} = 3.841$
:::

The observed test statistic is less than the critical value, we can not
reject the null hypothesis that the sample data follows
$\small N(38.567, 12.982^2 )$ .

Test result can be verified using \'Goodness of Fit Test\' in
『eStatU』. In the Input box that appears by selecting the \'Goodness of
Fit Test\' module, enter the data for \'observation frequency\' and
\'expected probability\' in Table 11.1.4, as shown in \<Figure 11.1.9\>.
After entering the data, select the significance level and press the

## 11.2 Testing Hypothesis for Contingency Table

::: mainTable
The contingency table or cross table discussed in Chapter 4 was a table
that placed the possible values of two categorical variables in rows and
columns, respectively, and examined frequencies of each cell in which
the values of the two variables intersect. If this contingency table is
for sample data taken from a population, it is possible to predict what
would be the contingency table of the population. The test for the
contingency table is usually an analysis of the relation between two
categorical variables and it can be divided into the independence test
and homogeneity test according to the sampling method for obtaining the
data.
:::

### 11.2.1 Independence Test

::: mainTable
The independence test of the contingency table is to investigate whether
two categorical variables are independent when samples are extracted
from one population. Consider the independence test with the following
example.
:::

::: mainTableGrey
**Example 11.2.1** In order to investigate whether college students who
are wearing glasses are independent by gender, a sample of 100 students
was collected and its contingency table was prepared as follows:

::: textLeft

:::

          Wear Glasses   No Glasses   Total
  ------- -------------- ------------ -------
  Men     40             10           50
  Women   20             30           50
  Total   60             40           100

Select \'Line Graph\' icon from the main menu. If you click variables
'Gender', 'Glasses', 'NoGlasses' one by one, then a line graph as shown
in \<Figure 11.2.2\> will appear in the Graph Area. If you look at the
line graph, you can see that the ratio of wearing glasses for men and
women are different. For men, there are many students who do not wear
glasses (80% of men) and for women, 60% of women do. In such cases, the
gender variable and the wearing of glasses are considered related. As
such, when two variables are related, two lines of the line graph
intersect to each other.

::: textL20M20
2\) If two variables are not related (i.e., if the two variables are
independent of each other), the contingency table in Table 11.2.1 will
show that the proportion of wearing glasses by men or women is equal to
60% which is the proportion of all students wearing glasses. In other
words, if two variables are independent, the contingency table should be
as follows:
:::

::: textLeft

independent

          Wear Glasses   No Glasses   Total
  ------- -------------- ------------ -------
  Men     30             20           50
  Women   30             20           50
  Total   60             40           100

::: textL20
If there is little difference between the observed contingency table and
the contingency table in the case of independence, two categorical
variables are said to be independent of each other. If the differences
are very large, two categorical variables are related to each other. The
independence test is a statistical method for determining that two
categorical variables of the population are independent of each other by
using the observed contingency table obtained from the sample. The
independent test uses the chi-square distribution and the hypothesis is
as follows:
:::

::: textLeft
$\small H_0 :$ Two variables of the contingency table are independent of
each other.
:::

::: textLeft
$\small H_1 :$ Two variables of the contingency table are related.
:::

::: textL20
The test statistic for testing this hypothesis utilizes the difference
between the observed frequency of the contingency table in the sample
and the expected frequency of the contingency table when two variables
are assumed to be independent which is similar to the goodness of fit
test. The test statistic in this example is as follows:
:::

::: textLeft
$\chi_{obs}^{2~} = \frac{(40-30)^{2}}{30} + \frac{(10-20)^{2}}{20} + \frac{(20-30)^{2}}{30} + \frac{(30-20)^{2}}{20}$
= 16.67
:::

::: textL20
This test statistic follows a chi-square distribution with $(r-1)(c-1)$
degrees of freedom where $r$ is the number of rows (number of possible
values of row variable) and $c$ is the number of columns (number of
possible values of column variable). Therefore, the decision rule to
test the hypothesis is as follows:
:::

::: textLeft
\'If $\chi_{obs}^{2} > \chi_{(r-1)(c-1); α}^{2}$, then reject
$\small H_0$.\'
:::

::: textL20
In this example, $\chi_{obs}^{2}$ = 16.67 is greater than the critical
value
$\chi_{(r-1)(c-1); α}^{2} = \chi_{(2-1)(2-1); 0.05}^{2} = \chi_{1; 0.05}^{2}$
= 3.841. Therefore, the null hypothesis that two variables are
independent each other is rejected and we conclude that the gender and
wearing glasses are related.

If the null hypothesis $H_0 :$ is true, i.e., if two variables are
independent of each other, the expected frequency of the sample data
will be $n p_{i \cdot} p_{\cdot j}$. Since we do not know the population
$p_i$ and $p_j$, if we use the estimates of $\frac {T_{i \cdot}}{n}$ and
$\frac {T_{\cdot j}}{n}$, then the estimate of the expected frequency,
$E_{ij}$, is as follows: $$
        E_{ij} = n( \frac {T_{i\cdot}} {n} )( \frac {T_{\cdot j}} {n} ) = T_{i\cdot} ( \frac {T_{\cdot j}} {n} )
      $$ The expected frequencies in case of independent can be
explained that the proportions of each attribute of the B variable,
$( \frac {T_{\cdot 1}} {n}, \frac {T_{\cdot 2}} {n}, ... , \frac {T_{\cdot r}} {n} )$,
are maintained in each attribute of the $A$ variable.

:::

::: textL20
$\small\qquad H_0$: Region and beverage preference are independent.\
$\small\qquad H_1$: Region and beverage preference are not independent.
:::

In order to calculate the expected frequencies, we first calculate the
proportions of each beverage preference without considering the region
as follows:

$\qquad ( \frac{162}{500}, \frac{88}{500}, \frac{50}{500} )$
:::

::: textL20
If two variables are independent, these proportions should be kept in
each region. Hence, the expected frequencies in each region can be
calculated as follows:

$\small\qquad E_{11} = 140 \times \frac{162}{500} = 45.36, \quad E_{12} = 140 \times \frac{188}{500} = 52.64, \quad E_{13} = 140 \times \frac{150}{500} = 42.00$
$\small\qquad E_{21} = 171 \times \frac{162}{500} = 55.40, \quad E_{22} = 171 \times \frac{188}{500} = 64.30, \quad E_{23} = 171 \times \frac{150}{500} = 51.30$
$\small\qquad E_{31} = 189 \times \frac{162}{500} = 61.24, \quad E_{32} = 189 \times \frac{188}{500} = 71.06, \quad E_{33} = 189 \times \frac{150}{500} = 56.70$
:::

::: textL20
The chi-square test statistic and critical value are as follows:

$\qquad \chi_{obs}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \; \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij} )^2 }{E_{ij}} = \frac{(52 -45.36)^2}{45.36} + \frac{(60-55.40)^2}{55.40} + \cdots + \frac{(74-56.70)^2}{56.70}$
= 18.825

$\qquad \chi_{(r-1)(c-1); α}^2 = \chi_{(3-1)(3-1); 0.05}^2 = \chi_{4; 0.05}^2$
= 9.488

As described in Chapter 4, if a contingency table is made using raw data
(\<Figure 11.2.9\>), 『eStat』provides the result of the independence
test as shown in \<Figure 11.2.10\>. In this case, if a cell of the
contingency table has a small expected number, the test result should be
interpreted carefully.

The independence test described in the previous section were for the
contingency table of two categorical variables based on sample data from
one population. However, similar contingency table may be taken from
several populations, where each sample is drawn from such a different
population. It can often be seen when the research is more efficiently
to be done or when time and space constraints are imposed. For example,
if you want to compare the English scores of freshman, sophomore, junior
and senior students in a university, it is reasonable to take samples
from each grade and analyze them. In this case, the contingency table is
as follows:
:::

::: textLeft
Table 11.2.7 A contingency table of English score by grade level
:::

  Score \\ Grade   Freshman   Sophomore   Junior   Senior
  ---------------- ---------- ----------- -------- --------
  A                \-         \-          \-       \-
  B                \-         \-          \-       \-
  C                \-         \-          \-       \-
  D                \-         \-          \-       \-

::: mainTable
If this contingency table is derived from each grade population, the
question we are curious is not an independence of the English score and
grade level, but four distributions of English scores are equal. The
hypothesis for a contingency table of samples drawn from multiple
populations is as follows. It is called the homogeneity test.

::: textL20
$H_0$: Distributions of several populations for a categorical variable
are homogeneous.\
$H_1$: Distributions of several populations for a categorical variable
are not homogeneous.
:::

The test statistic for the homogeneity test is the same as the
independence test as follows: $$
        \chi_{obs}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sum_{j=1}^{c} \frac {(O_{ij} - E_{ij} )^2} {E_{ij}} 
      $$ Here $r$ is the number of attributes of row variable and $c$ is
the number of populations.

**Homogeneity Test**

**Hypothesis:**

::: textL20
$H_0$: Distributions of several populations for a categorical variable
are homogeneous.\
$H_1$: Distributions of several populations for a categorical variable
are not homogeneous.

**Decision Rule:** $$
        \text{‘If}\quad \chi_{obs}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sum_{j=1}^{c} \frac {(O_{ij} - E_{ij} )^2} {E_{ij}} \gt \chi_{(r-1)(c-1); α}^2,\; \text{then reject}\;\; H_0 ’
      $$ Here $r$ is the number of attributes of row variable and $c$ is
the number of populations.

cell is combined with adjacent cell for analysis.

**Example 11.2.3** In order to investigate whether viewers of TV
programs are different by age for three programs (A, B and C), 200, 100
and 100 samples were taken separately from the population of young
people(20s), middle-aged people (30s and 40s), and older people (50s and
over) respectively. Their preference of the program were summarized as
follows. Test whether TV program preferences vary by age group at the
significance level of 5%.

::: textLeft
Table 11.2.8 Preference of TV program by age group
:::

  TV Program \\ Age Group   Young   Middle Aged   Older   Total
  ------------------------- ------- ------------- ------- -------
  A                         120     10            10      140
  B                         30      75            30      135
  C                         50      15            60      125
  Total                     200     100           100     400

**Answer**

The hypothesis of this problem is as follows:

::: textL20
$\quad \small H_0$: TV program preferences for different age groups are
homogeneous.\
$\quad \small H_1$: TV program preferences for different age groups are
not homogeneous.
:::

Proportions of the number of samples for each age group are as follows:

::: textL20
$\quad ( \frac{200}{400}, \frac{100}{400}, \frac{100}{400} )$
:::

Therefore, the expected frequencies of each program when is true are as
follows:

If two variables are independent, these proportions should be kept in
each region. Hence, the expected frequencies in each region can be
calculated as follows:

::: textL20
$\small \quad E_{11} = 140 \times \frac{200}{400} = 70.00, \quad E_{12} = 140 \times \frac{100}{400} = 35.00, \quad E_{13} = 140 \times \frac{100}{400} = 35.00$
$\small \quad E_{21} = 135 \times \frac{200}{400} = 67.50, \quad E_{22} = 135 \times \frac{100}{400} = 33.75, \quad E_{23} = 135 \times \frac{100}{400} = 33.75$
$\small \quad E_{31} = 125 \times \frac{200}{400} = 62.50, \quad E_{32} = 125 \times \frac{100}{400} = 31.25, \quad E_{33} = 125 \times \frac{100}{400} = 31.25$
:::

The chi-square test statistic and critical value are as follows:

$\qquad \chi_{obs}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \; \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij} )^2 }{E_{ij}} = \frac{(120-70)^2}{70} + \frac{(10-35)^2}{35} + \cdots + \frac{(60-31.25)^2}{31.25}$
= 180.495

$\qquad \chi_{(r-1)(c-1); α}^2 = \chi_{(3-1)(3-1); 0.05}^2 = \chi_{4; 0.05}^2$
= 9.488

Since $\chi_{obs}^2$ is greater than the critical value, $\small H_0$ is
rejected. TV programs have different preferences for different age
groups.
