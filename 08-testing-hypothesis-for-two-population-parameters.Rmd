### CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

In Chapter 7, we discussed how to test hypotheses about parameters in a
single population.

In this chapter, we discuss testing hypothesis to compare population
parameters of two populations.

Section 8.1 discusses a t-test for testing hypothesis of two population
means when samples are independent and when samples are paired.

Section 8.2 discusses a F-test for testing hypothesis of two population
variances.

Section 8.3 discusses a Z-test for testing hypothesis of two population
proportions when samples are large enough.

There are many examples comparing means of two populations as follows:

::: textL30M10
\- Is there a difference between the starting salary of male graduates
and of female graduates in this year's college graduates?
:::

::: textL30M10
\- Is there a difference in the weight of the products produced in the
two production lines?
:::

::: textL30M10
\- Did the special training for typists to increase the speed of typing
really bring about an increase in the speed of typing?
:::

As such, a comparison of the two population means ( and ) is possible by
testing hypothesis that the difference in the population means is
greater than, or less than, or equal to zero. The comparison of two
population means differs depending on whether samples are extracted
independently from each population or not (referred to as paired
samples).
:::

#### 8.1.1 Two Independent Samples

::: mainTable
Generally, testing hypothesis for two population means can be divided
into three types, depending on the type of the alternative hypothesis as
follows. $$ 
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft 1)\quad H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 \qquad H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 \gt D_0 \\
        \shoveleft 2)\quad H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 \qquad H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 \lt D_0 \\
        \shoveleft 3)\quad H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 \qquad H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 \ne D_0 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Here $D_0$ is the value for the difference in population means
to be tested.

When samples are selected independently from each other in the
population, the estimator of the difference of the population means
$\mu_1 - \mu_2$ is the difference in sample means
${\overline x}_1 - {\overline x}_2$. The sampling distribution of all
possible sample mean differences is approximately a normal distribution
with the mean $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ and variance
$\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}$ if both sample sizes
are large enough.

Since the population variances $\sigma^2_1$ and $\sigma^2_2$ are usually
unknown, estimates of these variances, $s^2_1$ and $s^2_2$, are used to
test the hypothesis. The test statistic differs slightly depending on
the assumption of two population variances. If two populations follow
normal distributions and their variances can be assumed the same, the
testing hypothesis for the difference of two population means uses the
following statistic. $$ 
        \frac { ({\overline x}_1 - {\overline x}_2 ) - D_0 }{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_p}{n_1} +\frac{s^2_p}{n_2} } } 
        \qquad \text{where } s^2_p  = \frac{(n_1 -1 )s^2_1 + (n_2 -1)s^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 -2}
      $$ $s^2_p$ is an estimator of the population variance called as a
**pooled variance** which is an weighted average of two sample variances
$s^2_1$ and $s^2_2$ by using the sample sizes as weights when population
variances are assumed to be the same.

The above statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n_1 + n_2 -2$
degrees of freedom and it is used to test the difference of two
population means as follows:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: If sample sizes are large enough ($n_1 > 30, n_2 >30$),
$t$-distribution is approximately close to the standard normal
distribution and the decision rule may use the standard normal
distribution.

**Example 8.1.1** Two machines produce cookies at a factory and the
average weight of a cookie bag should be 270g. Cookie bags were sampled
from each of two machines to examine the weight of the cookie bag. The
average weight of 15 cookie bags extracted from the machine 1 was 275g
and their standard deviation was 12g, and the average weight of 14
cookie bags extracted from the machine 2 was 269g and the standard
deviation was 10g. Test whether weights of cookie bags produced by two
machines are different at the 1% significance level. Check the test
result using 『eStatU』.

**Answer**

The hypothesis of this problem is
$\small H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 ,\, H_1 : \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$. Hence the
decision rule is as follows. $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft '\text{If } \left | \frac { ({\overline x}_1 - {\overline x}_2 ) - D_0 }{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_p}{n_1} +\frac{s^2_p}{n_2} } } \right | > t_{n_1 + n_2 -2; α/2} , \text{ then reject } H_0 ’ \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ where $\small D_0 = 0$ and the information in this example can
be summarized as follows. $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft n_1 = 15,\quad \overline x_1 = 275,\quad s_1 = 12 \\
        \shoveleft n_2 = 14,\quad \overline x_2 = 269,\quad s_2 = 10 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Therefore, the calculation of the statistics are as follows.
$$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft s^2_p  = \frac{(n_1 -1 )s^2_1 + (n_2 -1)s^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 -2} 
          = \frac{(15 - 1 ) 12^2 + (14 - 1) 10^2}{15 + 14 -2} = 122.815 \\
        \shoveleft \left | \frac {275 - 269} { \sqrt{\frac{122.815}{15} +\frac{122.815}{14} } } \right | = 1.457 \\
        \shoveleft t_{15 + 14 -2; 0.01/2} = t_{27: 0.005} = 2.7707 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Since 1.457 \< 2.7707, $H_0$ can not be rejected.

In 『eStatU』 menu, select 'Testing Hypothesis $\mu_1 , \mu_2$', In the
window shown in \<Figure 8.1.1\>, check the alternative hypothesis of
not equal case at \[Hypothesis\], check the variance assumption of
\[Test Type\] as the equal case, check the significance level of 1%,
check the independent sample, and enter sample sizes $n_1 , n_2$, sample
means $\overline x_1 , \overline x_2$, and sample variances as in

If variances of two populations are different, the test statistic $$

normally distributed. The testing hypothesis for two population means
when their population variances are different is called a Behrens-Fisher
problem and several methods to solve this problem have been studied. The
Satterthwaite method approximates the degrees of freedom of the
$t$-distribution in the decision rule in Table 8.1.1 with $\phi$ as
follows. $$
        \phi = \frac { \left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2 }

**Example 8.1.2** If two population variances are assumed to be
different in \[Example 8.1.1\], test whether weights of cookie bags
produced from two machines are equal or not at a 1% significance level.
Check the test result using 『eStatU』.

**Answer**

Since the population variances are different, the degrees of freedom of
distribution is approximated as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \phi = \frac { \left( \frac{12^2}{15} + \frac{10^2}{14} \right)^2 }
                     { \frac { \left( \frac{12^2}{15} \right)^2 } {15 -1} + \frac { \left( \frac{10^2}{14} \right)^2 } {14 - 1} } = 26.67 \\
        \shoveleft t_{26.7; 0.01/2} = 2.773 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Since 1.457 \< 2.773, $H_0$ can not be rejected.

::: mainTable
The testing hypothesis for two population means in the previous section
is based on two samples extracted independently from each population.
However, in some cases it is difficult to extract samples independently,
or if samples are extracted independently, then the resulting analysis
may be meaningless, because characteristics of each sample differ too
much.

For example, you want to give typists a special education to increase
the speed of typing and want to see if this training has been effective
in the speed of typing. In this case, if different samples are extracted
before and after education, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness
of education, because individual differences are severe. In order to
overcome the individual difference for a typist who has sampled before
training education, if you measure the typing speed before and after the
training for the typist, the effect of special education can be well
understood.

A hypothesis test that uses same samples to perform similar experiments
to compare means of two populations is called a paired comparison. In
the paired comparison, we calculate the difference ($d_i$) between
paired data $x_{i1}$ and $x_{i2}$ as shown in Table 8.1.3 and obtain the
mean of differences ($\overline d$) and variance of differences
($s_{d}^2$).

When two populations of normal distributions have the same mean, the
sample statistic $\frac{\overline d}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}$ follows a
$t$-distribution with the $n-1$ degrees of freedom. It allows the
testing of the difference between two population means in case of the
paired comparison as follows.

**Answer**

This problem is for testing the null hypothesis
$\small H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ to the alternative hypothesis
$\small H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 < 0$ to compare the typing speed of typists
before training (population 1) and after training (population 2) using
paired samples. Therefore, the decision rule is as follows. $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \text{If } \frac{\overline d - D_0}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} < - t_{n-1; α}, \text{ then reject } H_0 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Calculated differences ($d_i$) of paired samples before and
after training, the mean ($\overline d$) and standard deviation ($s_d$)
of differences are as follows.

                                                        Mean of $d_i$ :
                                                        $\overline d = -3.5$\
                                                        Standard deviation of
                                                        $d_i$ : $s_d = 3.16$
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The test statistic is as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \frac{\overline d - D_0}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{-3.5}{\frac{3.16}{\sqrt{8}}} \\
        \shoveleft - t_{n-1; α} = - t_{8-1: 0.05} = - t_{7: 0.05} = -1.8946 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Therefore, $\small H_0$ is rejected and conclude that the
training increased the typing speed.

Consider following examples to compare two population variances.

::: textL30M10
\- When comparing two population means in the previous section, we
studied that if the sample size was small, the decision rule for testing
hypothesis were different depending on whether two population variances
were the same or different. So how can we test if two population
variances are the same?
:::

::: textL30M10
\- The quality of bolts used to assemble cars depends on the strict
specification for their diameters. Average diameters of bolts produced
by two factories were said to be the same and if the variance of
diameters is smaller, it is considered as superior production. How can
you compare variances of the diameter?
:::

When comparing variances ($\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$) of two
populations, the ratio ($\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}$) of variances is
calculated instead of comparing the difference in variances. If the
ratio of variances is greater, smaller, or equal to 1, you can see that
$\sigma_1^2$ is greater, smaller, or equal to $\sigma_2^2$. The reason
for using the ratio of variances instead of the difference of variances
is that it is easy to find the sampling distribution of the ratio of
variances mathematically. If two populations follow normal
distributions, and if $n_1$ and $n_2$ samples are collected randomly
from each population, the ratio of two sample variances $S_1^2$ and
$S_2^2$ such as $$
        \frac{ \left( \frac{S_1^2}{\sigma_1^2} \right) } { \left( \frac{S_2^2}{\sigma_2^2} \right) }
      $$ follows a $F$-distribution with the numerator degrees of
freedom $n_1 - 1$ and the denominator degrees of freedom $n_2 - 1$.
Using this fact, we can perform testing hypothesis on the ratio of
population variances.

$F$-distribution is an asymmetrical distribution group with two
parameters, the numerator degrees of freedom and denominator degrees of
freedom. \<Figure 8.2.1\> shows $F$-distributions for different
parameters.

**Example 8.2.1** A company that produces a bolt has two plants. One
day, ten bolts produced in Plant 1 were sampled randomly and the
variance of diameter was $0.11^2$. 12 bolts produced in Plant 2 were
sampled randomly and the variance of diameter was $0.13^2$. Test whether
variances of the bolt from two plants are the same or not with the 5%
significance level. Check the test result using 『eStatU』.

**Answer**

The hypothesis of this problem is
$\small H_0 : \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 ,\; H_1 : \sigma_1^2 \ne \sigma_2^2$,
and its decision rule is as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \text{If } \frac {S_1^2}{S_2^2} < F_{n_1 -1, n_2 -1; 1-α/2}  \text{ or } 
             \frac {S_1^2}{S_2^2} > F_{n_1 -1, n_2 -1; α/2} \text{ then reject } H_0  
        \end{multline}
      $$ The test statistic using two sample variances and the
percentile of $\small F$-distribution is as follows. $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft  \frac {S_1^2}{S_2^2} = \frac{0.0121}{0.0169} = 0.716 \\ 
        \shoveleft   F_{n_1 -1, n_2 -1; 1-α/2} = F_{11,9;0.975} = 0.279 \\  
        \shoveleft   F_{n_1 -1, n_2 -1; α/2}   = F_{11,9;0.025} = 3.912 \\  
        \end{multline}
      $$ Hence the hypothesis $\small H_0$ can not be rejected and
conclude that two variances are equal.

Comparing proportions $p_1$ and $p_2$ of two populations is possible by
testing the difference between two proportions $p_1 - p_2$ as the
comparison of two population means. The difference in sample proportions
${\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2$ from two populations follows a normal
distribution with the mean $p_1 - p_2$ and variance
$\frac{p_1 (1-p_1 )}{n_1} + \frac{p_2 (1-p_2 )}{n_2}$ when two sample
sizes are large enough. Since we do not know population proportions
$p_1$ and $p_2$ to estimate the variance, weighted average value
$\overline p$ for two sample proportions ${\hat p}_1$ and ${\hat p}_2$
by using sample sizes as weights is used as follows:

$$
         \overline p = \frac { n_1 {\hat p}_1 + n_2 {\hat p}_2 } {n_1 + n_2 }
      $$ The testing hypothesis for two population proportions uses the
following test statistic. $$
        \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } } 
      $$

**Example 8.3.1** A survey was conducted for a presidential election and
samples were selected independently from both male and female
populations. 54 out of 225 samples from the male population supported
the candidate A and 52 out of 175 samples from the female population
supported the candidate A. Test whether there is a difference in
approval ratings of the male and female populations with the 5%
significance level. Check the result using 『eStatU』.

**Answer**

The hypothesis of this problem is
$\small \; H_0 : p_1 = p_2 , H_1 : p_1 \ne p_2$, and its decision rule
is as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft '\text{If } \left | \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }  \right | > z_{α/2}, \text{ then reject } H_0
        \end{multline}
      $$ Since ${\hat p}_1 = \frac{54}{225}$ = 0.240,
${\hat p}_2 = \frac{52}{175} = 0.297,\; \overline p$ and the test
statistic can be calculated as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \overline p = \frac{54 + 52}{ 225 + 175} = \frac{106}{400} = 0.265 \\
        \shoveleft \left | \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }  \right |  
           = \left | \frac { {0.240} - {0.297} } { \sqrt{ \frac{0.265(1 - 0.265)}{225} + \frac{0.265(1 - 0.265)}{175}  } }  \right | = 1.28\\
        \shoveleft z_{α/2} = z_{0.05/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Therefore, the hypothesis $\small H_0$ can not be rejected and
we conclude that there is not enough evidence that the approval ratings
of male and female are different.

In 『eStatU』 menu, select 'Testing Hypothesis $p_1 , p_2$' and enter
$n_1 = 225,\; {\hat p}_1 = 0.240,\; n_2 = 175,\; {\hat p}_2 = 0.297$ as
shown in \<Figure 8.3.1\>. Clicking the \[Execute\] button will show the
result of the hypothesis test as shown in \<Figure 8.3.2\>.

**Example 8.3.2** In 2000, a simple random sampling of 1,000 people aged
15 to 29 across the country examined the status of marriage, and 63.5
percent were single. In 2020, another 1,000 people were surveyed
independently, with 69.8 percent of them being single. From this fact,
can you say that there has been a tendency to get married late in recent
years? In other words, test at the 5% significance level whether the
population aged 15 to 29 in 2020 is more likely to be single than in
2000. What is the p-value of this test?

**Answer**

The hypothesis of this problem is
$\small \; H_0 : p_1 = p_2 , \; H_1 : p_1 < p_2$ , and its decision rule
is as follows. $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft '\text{If } \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }  < - z_{α},  \text{ then reject } H_0 ' \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Since ${\hat p}_1 = 0.635$ and ${\hat p}_2 = 0.698$,
$\overline p$ and the test statistic are as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \overline p = \frac{1000 \times 0.635 + 1000 \times 0.698}{1000 + 1000} = \frac{0.635 + 0.698}{2} = 0.667 \\
        \shoveleft \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }    
           =  \frac { {0.635} - {0.698} } { \sqrt{ \frac{0.667(1 - 0.667)}{1000} + \frac{0.667(1 - 0.667)}{1000}  } }  = -2.989\\
        \shoveleft - z_{α} = - z_{0.05} = -1.645 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$ Therefore, $\small H_0$ is rejected. and conclude that the
proportion of unmarried people in 2020 has been increased. $p$-value can
be calculated as follows: $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft p-\text{value} = P(Z \lt -2.989) = 0.0014 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$

In the previous two examples of comparing two population proportions,
two sample proportions were calculated from independent samples.

Suppose two candidates ran in an election and one thousand samples were
selected to test whether there was any difference on the candidate\'s
approval rating. The approval ratings $p_1$ and $p_2$ of two candidates
obtained from the sample are not independent, because unlike two
previous examples they are calculated from one set of samples. So the
test method should be different. The following statistic are used to
test whether there is a difference in approval ratings of two
candidates. $$
        \frac{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}{\sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}},\quad 
        \text{ where } \sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1 (1-p_1) + p_2 (1-p_2) +2p_1 p_2}{n}}
      $$ Here, $\sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}$ is the standard error
of ${\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2$.

Assuming that two population proportions are equal, the estimated value
$\sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}$ is as follows $$
        \sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \overline p}{n}}, \text { where } \overline p = \frac{{\hat p}_1 + {\hat p}_2}{2} 
      $$ If the sample size is large, the test statistic follows a
normal distribution which allows proper testing hypothesis according to
the form of the alternative hypothesis. As such, it is important to
distinguish between sample proportions from independent samples and not
independent samples when we compare two population proportions.

8.12 One person is considering the use of a test to compare between two
population means. 16 samples are randomly taken from two populations and
their sample variances are 28.5 and 9.5. Is this data shows evidence
that two population variances are the same? (Significance level = 0.05)

8.13 Certain studies have been planned to compare the two relaxing drugs
for office workers in stressful jobs. A medical team sampled eight
workers for each of two drugs and collected data on the strain. Two
sample variances are $s_1^2$ = 2916 and $s_2^2$ = 4624. Using the
significance level of 0.05, can this data be said to differ in two
population variances of tension? Explain necessary assumptions.

8.15 Both tire products are known to have an average life span of 80,000
km. However, there seems to be a difference in the variance. Sixteen
tires from each of two companies were randomly selected and run under
similar conditions to measure their life span. Sample variances were
4,500 and 2,200, respectively.

8.16 A carpet manufacturer is looking for materials that can withstand
temperature above 250 degree Fahrenheit. One of two materials is a
natural material and the other is a cheap artificial material, which
both have the same properties except for heat-resistant levels. As a
result of a heat-resistant experiment by independently selecting 250
samples from each of two materials, 36 samples from natural materials
and 45 samples from man-made materials failed at temperatures above 250
degrees Fahrenheit. Is there a difference in the heat resistance of two
materials from this data using the significance level is 0.05?

8.17 A labor union of a company found that 63 percent of 150 salespeople
who did not receive a college education wanted to take it back even now.
The company did a similar study 10 years ago, when only 58 percent of
160 people wanted it. Test the null hypothesis that the desire for
college education is not different from 10 years ago using the
significance level of 0.05. Samples were selected independently.

8.18 When we extracted 200 companies of the type A and examined them, we
found that 12% of them spent more than 1% of their total sales on
advertising. The other 200 companies of the type B independently
selected and examined, we found 15% of them spent more than 1% of their
total sales on advertising. Test the following hypotheses with the
significance level of 0.05. $$ \small
        H_0 : p_B \le p_A , H_1 : p_B \gt p_A 
      $$

8.19 In a company, a study was conducted on the leisure activities of
sales staffs and managing staffs. 400 persons were selected
independently from each of sales and managing staffs. 288 sales and 260
managing staffs answered that they usually spend their leisure time on
sports activities. From this data, can you say that the percentage of
two groups for the leisure time spent on sports activities is the same?
Use the significance level of 0.05.

8.20 In September 2013, a research institute surveyed 260 men and 263
women about a political issue and the response result is as follows. Do
you think there are significant differences in their way of thinking on
the political issue?\' Specify the null hypothesis and the alternative
hypothesis and test at the 5% significance level.

  Yes   57%   65%
  No    43%   35%

8.21 In order to see whether the unemployment rate in two cities are
different, samples of 500 people were randomly selected from two cities
and found unemployment persons were 35 and 25 respectively. Can you say
that the unemployment rate in two cities is different? Describe the
necessary assumptions and calculate the $p$-value.
