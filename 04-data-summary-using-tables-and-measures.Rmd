**CHAPTER OBJECTIVES**

Chapter 2 and 3 discussed how to visualize both the qualitative data and
the quantitative data using graphs. Visualizing data using graphs makes
easy and fast to see any information that is nested in data. However, if
you want more detailed information, it is better to summarize data by
using tables or measures.

In section 4.1, we introduce a frequency table as a summary of single
variable.

In section 4.2, we introduce a contingency table as a summary of two
variables.

In section 4.3, we introduced measures to summarize the quantitative
data and a box plot.

A frequency table of qualitative data summarizes frequencies of each
possible value of a categorical variable. A frequency table is the most
commonly used tool to summarize qualitative data. The frequency table
also shows relative frequencies (percents) which are calculated by
dividing the frequency of each category with the number of observations
belong to the category, and cumulative relative frequencies accumulated
in the order of the categories. The bar graph, the pie chart and the
band graph in Chapter 2 are drawn by using this frequency table of
qualitative data. The frequency table is usually used to summarize
qualitative data, but it can also be used to summarize quantitative data
by transforming it to qualitative data. All possible values of the
quantitative data are divided into several intervals which are not
overlapped with each other and the number of observations belong to each
interval is counted to make a frequency table.

**Example 4.1.1** **(Gender Raw Data)**

In Example 2.3.1, a bar graph of the gender variable in a class was
drawn by using the raw data shown in Table 4.1.1. The bar graph was able
to be drawn by using the frequencies of male and female students. Use
『eStat』 to create a frequency table for this raw data of the gender
variable.

### Frequency Table for Quantitative Variable

::: mainTable
The quantitative data can have too many possible values and a frequency
table of the quantitative data may not be easy to analyze. In order to
make a frequency table for quantitative data which can be analyzed
easily, possible values of the data are divided into several intervals
and frequencies of each interval are investigated. Generally, the
intervals are not overlapped with each other and the number of data in
each interval is counted. For this purpose, the maximum and the minimum
of data are first investigated to calculate the range of the data and
then determine the number of intervals. The number of intervals is
typically between 5 and 10, but it may depend on a researcher's choice.
Some researchers prefer to use the square root of the number of
observations. If the number of intervals is determined, the range of
data (maximum - maximum) is divided by the number of intervals to
calculate the width of the interval. Starting and ending points of each
interval are usually described as 'from greater than or equal (≥)
$a$\'to less than (\<) $b$ ' which means a one-sided closed interval
\[$a$ ,$b$ ).

::: mainTable
![](Icon/eStat_icon18_freq.png){.imgIcon}\
A contingency table or cross table is used to summarize two categorical
variables and is also used to study an association of two variables. A
cross table divides a table into rows and columns to create cells by
using possible values of two categorical variables, and then counts the
number of observations (frequency) belonging to the corresponding cell.
Percentage of each cell for the sum of rows, or percentage of each cell
for the sum of columns can be shown in a contingency table for further
analysis. Percentage of each cell for the total number of data can also
be shown in a cross table.

A contingency table is usually made for two qualitative data. In case of
two quantitative data, the quantitative data can be transformed into
qualitative data by using intervals, and then a contingency table for
these qualitative data can be created.

### Contingency Table for Two Quantitative Variables

::: mainTable
In order to create a contingency table for two quantitative variables,
we need to divide all possible values of each quantitative variable into
some number of intervals as we did when creating a frequency table of
single quantitative variable.

If both variables are quantitative, it is advisable to use a statistical
software such as R, SPSS, and SAS etc. If one variable is categorical
and the other one is quantitative, then a contingency table can be made
by using 『eStat』. Let\'s take a look at the following example.
:::

::: mainTableGrey
**Example 4.2.2** **(Teacher's Age by Gender)**\

## Summary Measures for Quantitative Variable

::: mainTable
The quantitative data can be summarized by using measures of central
tendancy in section 4.3.1 and measures of dispersion in 4.3.2.
:::

### Measures of Central Tendency

::: mainTable
Average, median and mode are the most frequently used measures of
central tendency to summarize the quantitative data.

A **mean or average** is the sum of all data values divided by the
number of data. If data $x_1 ,x_2 ,\cdots, x_N$ are from a population,
the mean of this data is referred to as a population mean and is usually
denoted as $\mu$ in Greek letter. The calculation formula can be defined
as follows. $$
        \small \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i 
      $$ If data $x_1 ,x_2 ,\cdots,x_n$ are sampled from a population,
the mean of this data is referred as a sample mean and denoted as
$\overline x$ (read as \'x bar\'). then the mean $\overline x$ is
defined as follows. $$
        \small \overline x = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i 
      $$ Note that both the population mean and sample mean have the
same formula except notation. Also, note that the mean is heavily
influenced by an extreme point where one data value is either very large
or very small.

The sample mean can be understood as the center of gravity representing
sample data. Therefore, the sum of deviations which subtract the sample
mean from each of the sample data is zero as follows. $$
        \small \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline x ) = 0 
      $$

The sample mean has many good characteristics (Chapter 6) and is
frequently used to estimate the population mean.

A **median** is the value placed in the middle when data are listed in
ascending order of their values and is denoted as $M$ if data are from a
population or $m$ if data are sampled from a population. If the number
of sample data, $n$, is an odd number, the median is the data value
located at the ${\left( n+1 \above 1pt 2 \right)}^\text{th}$ when data
are arranged in ascending order. If $n$ is an even number, then the
median is the average of the data values located at the
${\left( n \above 1pt 2 \right)}^\text{th}$ and
${\left( n+2 \above 1pt 2 \right)}^\text{th}$.

$$
        \begin{align}
        m &= \left( \frac{n+1}{2}\right)^\text{th} \text{ data } & \text{if $n$ is odd}\\
          &= \frac{ (\frac{n}{2})^\text{th} + \left(\frac{n+2}{2} \right)^\text{th} \text{ data }}{2} & \text{if $n$ is even}
        \end{align}
      $$

The median is not sensitive even if there is an extreme point in data,
so it is often used as a measure of the central tendency when there is
an extreme point.

A **mode** is the most frequently occurred value among data values. $$
        \small \textit{Mode} = \text{the most frequently occurred value among data values}
      $$ In case of the quantitative data, since there might be so many
possible values, it is not reasonable to set a mode value as the most
frequently occurred data value. In this case, we usually transform the
quantitative data into the qualitative data by dividing the data values
into several not-overlapped intervals and count frequencies of each
interval. The middle value of an interval which has the highest
frequency is set to the mode.
:::

::: mainTableYellow
**Mean, Median and Mode**

**Mean** or **average** is the sum of all observed data divided by the
number of data. The mean can be understood as the center of gravity
representing data. The population mean is denoted as $\mu$ and the
sample mean is denoted as $\overline x$.

**Median** is the value placed in the middle when data are listed in
ascending order of their values. The population median is usually
denoted as $M$ and the sample median is denoted as $m$.

**Mode** is the most frequently occurred value among data values.

Calculate the mean and median of this data and compare the result with
『eStat』 output.

**Answer**

The sample mean is calculated as follows.

$\qquad \small \overline x ~=~ { {5 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 4 + 8} \over 7} ~=~ 6$

In order to find the sample median, first arrange the data in ascending
order of data values as follows:

::: textLeft
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
:::

Since the sample size, 7, is an odd number, median is
$\small {\left( 7+1 \over 2 \right)}^{th} ~=~4^{th}$ data in the
arranged data as above which is 6.

There are several variants to compensate the disadvantage of the mean,
one of which is a trimmed mean. This is to list the data in order and
then average the data except for a constant number of large and small
values respectively in order to eliminate the extremes. The trimmed mean
is often used to prevent biased judging by referees in sports such as
gymnastics and figure skating at the Olympics. You may remove the top
few percent data instead of the maximum and the bottom few percent data
instead of the minimum.

Another variant is a weighted mean in which each measurement is
multiplied by a constant weight to obtain the mean. The grade point
average for college students which uses the weights of credit hours is
an example of the weighted mean. The price index which uses the weights
of the total amount of sales of the goods is another example of the
weighted mean. If $x_{1} ,x_{2}, \dots , x_{n}$ are the data values and
their weights are $w_{1} , w_{2} ,\dots , w_{n}$, then the weighted mean
is defined as the following. $$
        \text{Weighted Mean} ~=~ { {w_{1} x_{1} +w_{2} x_{2} + \cdots + w_{n} x_{n}} \over {w_{1} + w_{2} + \cdots + w_{n}} } ~=~ { {\sum _{i=1} ^{n} w_{i} x_{i}} \over {\sum _{i=1} ^{n} w_{i}} }

**Trimmed Mean and Weighted Mean**

**Trimmed mean** is the average of data except for a constant number of
large and small values respectively in order to eliminate extremes.

**Weighted mean** is the average of weighted sum in which each
measurement is multiplied by some weight and divided by the sum of all
weights.

**Example 4.3.3** **(Olympic Gymnastics Game)**\
An Olympic Gymnastics Game was judged by eight referees and their result
are as follows:

::: textLeft
9.0 9.5 9.3 7.2 10.0 9.1 9.4 9.0
:::

Find the mean and median of this data. Also, find the trimmed mean which
excludes the minimum and the maximum. Compare both results.

**Answer**

This data is not a sample but a population of eight. The mean is as
follows.

$\qquad \small \mu ~=~ (9.0 + 9.5 + 9.3 + 7.2 + 10.0 + 9.1 + 9.4 + 9.0) / 8 ~=~ 72.5 / 8 ~=~ 9.063$

Since the number of data is $\small N$ = 8 which is an even number, the
median is the average of the 4th and the 5th data in the ordered list as
follows:

::: textLeft
7.2 9.0 9.0 9.1 9.3 9.4 9.5 10.0
:::

Therefore, the median is the average of 9.1 and 9.3 which is 9.2.

The trimmed mean is the average of the remaining numbers, except the
minimum of 7.2 and the maximum of 10.0.

$\qquad \small \text{Trimmed Mean} ~=~ (9.0 + 9.0 + 9.1 + 9.3 + 9.4 + 9.5) / 6 ~=~ 55.3 / 6 ~=~ 9.217$

In this data, the median or the trimmed mean is more representative of
the data than the arithmetic mean.

**Example 4.3.4** **(Weighted Mean)**\
A student took three courses in History (two credits), Math (four
credits), and English (three credits) in last semester, and got A in
History, B in math and C in English. Calculate the mean and the weighted
mean with the number of credits if A is rated 4 points, B is 3 points,
and C is 2 points.

**Answer**

$\small  \qquad \text{Mean = } \frac{4 + 3 + 2 }{3} = 3$

$\small  \qquad \text{Weighted Mean = } \frac { 2×4 + 4×3 + 3×2 } { 2 + 4 + 3 } = \frac{ 8 + 12 + 6} {9} = 2.89$

Weighted mean is less than mean, because although the grade of History
which has two credits was A, the grade of English which has three
credits was relatively poor C.

### Measures of Dispersion

::: mainTable
In a gymnastics competition, four judges scored 3, 4, 6, and 7 points
for a player A and 2, 4, 6, and 8 points for a player B. Both players
have the same mean of 5, but it is easy to see that the player B has a
large deviation in the scores compared to the player A. Degree of data
dispersion is calculated using a numerical value to compare two sets of
data and it is called a measure of dispersion. The most commonly used
measure of dispersion is a variance (or standard deviation) and other
measures include a mean absolute deviation, a range, and an
inter-quartile range.

A variance is an average of all squared distances from each data to the
mean. Therefore, if data are spread widely around their mean, the
variance will be large, and if data are concentrated around the mean,
the variance will be small. A population variance is denoted as
$\sigma^2$, and a sample variance is denoted as $s^2$. Formulas to
calculate the population variance and the sample variance are slightly
different as follows. $$
        \begin{align}
          &\text{Population variance} &\quad \sigma^{2} ~&=~ { {1 \over N} {\sum _{i=1} ^{N} (x_{i} - \mu )^{2}}  } ~~~~    (N:~number~ of~ population~ data)  \\
          &\text{Sample variance} &\quad s^{2} ~&=~ { { 1 \over {n-1} }{\sum _{i=1} ^{n} (x_{i} - {\overline x } )  ^{2}}  } ~~~~       (n:~ number~ of~ sample~ data)  
        \end{align}
      $$ There are important reasons for using $n-1$ instead of $n$ when
calculating the sample variance which will be discussed in Chapter 6.
Meaning of the population variance, which is an average of all squared
distances from each data to the population mean, is illustrated in
\<Figure 4.3.6\>. In this Figure, dot mark represents each data value.
$\sigma^2$ = 2.5 is calculated as the sum of squared distances (10)
divided by the number of data, $n$ = 4 in this example.

![](Figure/Fig040306.png){.imgFig400300}

::: figText
\<Figure 4.3.6\> Calculation of a population variance
:::

A standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. A
population standard deviation is denoted as $\sigma$, and a sample
standard deviation is denoted as $\s$. The variance is not easy to
interpret, because it is an average of the squared distances. However,
since the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, it is
interpreted as an average distance from each data value to the mean. $$
        \begin{align}
          \sigma &=~ \sqrt {\sigma^2} \\
          s &=~ \sqrt {s^2}

as 6.

::: textLeft
5, 6, 3, 7, 9, 4 and 8
:::

Calculate a sample variance and a sample standard deviation of this
data.

**Answer**

The sample mean was calculated as follows.

$\small \qquad  \overline x ~=~ { { 5 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 4 + 8 } \over 7 } ~=~ 6.$

Since this data are sampled, the sample variance is calculated as
follows. Note that it is divided by (7-1).

$\small \qquad  s^{2} ~=~ { {(5-6)^{2} +(6-6)^{2} +(3-6)^{2} +(7-6)^{2} +(9-6)^{2} +(4-6)^{2} +(8-6)^{2}} \over {(7-1)} } =~ { {28} \over {6} } ~=~4.667$

The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance
.

$\small \qquad  s~=~ \sqrt {s ^{2}} ~=~ \sqrt {4.667} ~=~2.16$

These values coincide with the output of 『eStat』 in \<Figure 4.3.3\>
and the output of 『eStatU』 in \<Figure 4.3.4\>.

When there are more than two quantitative variables, if units of data
measurement are different from each other, comparing their standard
deviations is meaningless. In this case, a coefficient of variation
which is a division of the standard deviation by the mean, is used to
compare several variables. The coefficient of variation is usually
calculated as a percent value of the standard deviation to its mean. $$ 
        \begin{align}
          &\text{Population coefficient of variation} &C = \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \times 100    \quad \text{(unit %)} \\
          &\text{Sample coefficient of variation}  &c = \frac {s}  {\overline {x}} \times 100  \quad \text {(unit %)}

**Example 4.3.6** **(Sales data)**\
In a company, the average weekly sales was 1.36 billion dollar and its
standard deviation was 0.28 billion dollar. If the same data were made
in monthly sales, the average was 5.44 billion dollar and its standard
deviation was 0.5 billion dollar. Calculate a coefficient of variation
for each case and compare.

**Answer**

The coefficient of variation in weekly sales is as follows.

$\qquad \small  \frac{0.28}{1.36} \times 100 ~=~ 20.6\%,$

The coefficient of variation in monthly sales is as follows.

$\qquad \small  \frac{0.50}{5.44} \times 100 ~=~ 9.2\%.$

Therefore, we can see that the variation in monthly sales is smaller
than the variation in weekly sales.

A range is the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of
data. The range is easy to calculate, but it is not a good measure of
dispersion if there are extreme points. $$ 
        \text{Range = Maximum - Minimum}
      $$ A $p$-percentile implies roughly the percent data when data are
arranged in ascending order from small to large. $$ 
        p\text{-percentile} = p\%~ \text{of observations} \le \text{to this value and} ~(100-p)\% ~\ge~ \text{this value.}
      $$

Note that, if data size is small, a single observation may fall into
several percentiles according to this definition.

An inter-quartile range is a measure to complement the disadvantage of
the range. The 25 percentile of the data is called the 1st quartile
(Q1), the 50 percentile is called the 2nd quartile (Q2) or median, and
the 75 percentile is called the 3rd quartile (Q3). The inter-quartile
range (IQR) is the range between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile.
$$
        \text{Inter-quartile range  (IQR)  = Q3 - Q1 }
      $$

One simple way to calculate Q1 and Q3 is that, after we arrange the data
in ascending order, we divide the data into two pieces which have equal
number of data. In case of odd number of data, we include the median to
each piece of data. Q1 is the median of the 1st piece of data and Q3 is
the median of the 2nd piece of data.
:::

::: mainTableYellow
**Range, percentile, Quartile and Inter-quartile Range**

**Range** is the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of
data.

**$p$-percentile** is that there are p% of data less than or equal to
($\le$) this value and (100-p)% of data located above or equal to
($\ge$) this value. The 25 percentile of the data is called the 1st
quartile (Q1), the 50 percentile is called the 2nd quartile (Q2) or
median, and the 75 percentile is called the 3rd quartile (Q3).

**Inter-quartile range (IQR)** is the range between the 3rd quartile and
the 1st quartile.

**Example 4.3.7** If you have data 5, 3, 7, 9, find a range and an
inter-quartile range.

**Answer**

The maximum of the data is 9 and the minimum is 3, therefore range is as
follows.

$\qquad \small  \text{Range} ~=~ 9 – 3 ~=~ 6.$

In order to find the quartiles of the data, first arrange the data in
ascending order as follows.

::: textLeft
3, 5, 7, 9

The median of these numbers is the average of $({4 \over 2})^\text{th}$
and $({4 \over 2 + 1})^\text{th}$ data.

$\qquad \small  \text{Median} ~=~ \frac{(5 + 7)}{2} ~=~ 6.$

In order to calculate quartiles, since the number of data is even, we
divide data into two pieces as follows:

::: textLeft
3, 5
:::

::: textLeft

The first quartile Q1 is the median of {3, 5} which is Q1 = 4. The third
quartile Q3 is the median of {7. 9} which is Q3 = 8. So, the
inter-quartile range IQR is as follows.

**Answer**

The maximum of the data is 9 and the minimum is 3. Therefore, the range
is as follows.

$\qquad \small  \text{Range} ~=~ 9 – 3 ~=~ 6.$

In order to find quartiles of data, first arrange the data in ascending
order as follows.

::: textLeft
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
:::

The median of the data is the data value of
$({{7+1} \over 2})^\text{th} ~=~4^\text{th}$ which is 6.

In order to calculate the quartiles, since the number of data is odd,
divide the data into two pieces as follows. Note that the median is
included in both pieces of data.

::: textLeft
3, 4, 5, 6
:::

::: textLeft
6, 7, 8, 9

The first quartile Q1 is the median of {3, 4, 5, 6} which is Q1 = 4.5.
The third quartile Q3 is the median of \[6, 7. 8, 9\] which is Q3 = 7.5.
So, the inter-quartile range IQR is as follows.

$\qquad \small  \text{IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 7.5 – 4.5 = 3.}$

These values of Q1, Q3 and IQR coincide with the output of 『eStat』 in

**Practice 4.3.2** **(Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea
Pigs)**\
The effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea Pigs was examined. The
response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth
growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels
of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods,
orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).
Data can be found at the following location of 『eStat』.
